He describes having repeated infections and states that his younger brother used to have episodes of extreme pain and sadly passed away due to meningitis.  On examination, he has a fever, respiratory rate of 28, bi-basal crackles throughout his lung fields, and a normal abdominal exam. A chest x-ray shows bilateral infiltrations.",

                "An isolated vaso-occlusive crisis is more characterised by bone, back and abdominal pain, and often does not involve the chest.",
                "Correct. This occurs due to an inflammatory response to sickle cells occluding pulmonary vessels. The inflammation and occlusion lead to hypoxic vasoconstriction, hypoxia and further sickling. This is extremely difficult to distinguish from pneumonia.",
                "This is most commonly seen in children and not adults. Furthermore, we would expect a large spleen on palpation. ",
                "Marked features of anaemia and haemolysis (jaundice, dark urine) are not present in the history or examination.",
                "Aplastic anaemia often results following a viral infection, especially parvovirus B19. There is no history here of a “slapped cheek appearance” or coryza, which could hint towards a passing viral infection."

                "Hydroxycarbamide forms part of the management for chronic sickle cell disease. It works by increasing the available levels of foetal haemoglobin (HbF) via the means of increased gamma chain production. The production of HbF leads to fewer painful episodes due to less sickling.",
