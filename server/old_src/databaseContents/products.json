We may also expect to see characteristic signs of ischaemia or infarction on an ECG, including ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities (ST depression/elevation or T-wave inversion) or a new-onset left bundle branch block. The ECG here just shows sinus rhythm. This, combined with the normocytic anaemia, systolic flow murmur, and positive DAT test, makes acute haemolytic crisis the most likely diagnosis. \\n",

The presence of jaundice, combined with the normocytic anaemia, systolic flow murmur, and positive DAT test, makes acute haemolytic crisis the most likely diagnosis. In acute haemolysis, haemoglobin levels can drop dangerously low, meaning the cardiac output can no longer meet the perfusion demands of the body. Tachycardia is a compensatory mechanism (by increasing heart rate, we are able to pump haemoglobin around the body faster). However, if the tachycardia still cannot meet the perfusion demands, the heart may start to fail, leading to hypotension and shock. \\n",

The red nucleus in the midbrain which signals primitive locomotion is normally effectively inhibited due to corticospinal activity but without the activity, abnormal flexion occurs. </p> <p> Decerebrate is thought to arise due to extensive higher cerebral function loss. Higher cerebral function inhibits abnormal extensor movement that is normally signalled by the vestibular nucleus (communicating with spinal nerves through the vestibulospinal tract).

Although chemosis (conjunctival swelling) is a common feature in allergic conjunctivitis, the overall picture points to another diagnosis.",
                            "Correct. Neisserial conjunctivitis presents very acutely (within 12-24 hours) and patients often present with eye pain, eyelid swelling and copious amounts of purulent discharge from their eye. Corneal ulcers are common complications and account for the photophobia in this patient (conjunctivitis does not typically cause photophobia unless the cornea is involved). Preauricular lymphadenopathy is another classical feature of this too. The history of dysuria and purulent discharge from the penis should raise questions about a potential STI, which explains how he would have come into contact with the bacteria.",
                            "Although the STI symptoms could point you to this diagnosis, it is less likely than neisserial conjunctivitis. Inclusion conjunctivitis (most common type of chlamydial conjunctivitis in developed countries) can also cause preauricular lymphadenopathy, however you would expect papillary hyperplasia of the tarsal conjunctiva which is not mentioned in the stem. Furthermore, chlamydial conjunctivitis does not typically present as acutely as this.",
                            "Acute angle-closure glaucoma is an ocular emergency which must be ruled out in any patient presenting with acute eye pain and red eye. However, this is a less likely diagnosis simply based on the fact that you would not expect purulent discharge and preauricular lymphadenopathy. Although visual acuity is reduced in acute glaucoma, you would expect the pupil in the affected eye to be fixed, dilated and unresponsive to light; none of which are the case here.",
                            "Anterior uveitis is a very reasonable differential in this case. It accounts for the pain, reduced visual acuity and photophobia. However you would not expect such severe eyelid inflammation, purulent discharge or even chemosis.

This is the cause of Ramsay Hunt Syndrome which occurs due to the shingles virus (herpes zoster) being reactivated at the geniculate ganglion, affecting the facial nerve. It presents with a painful vesicular rash at the external ear canal and pinna, facial paralysis. The vestibulocochlear nerve (CNVIII) lies within close proximity to the facial nerve and can also be affected, possibly leading to hearing loss and vertigo. It is a differential to Bell’s palsy and thus herpes zoster is not a risk factor.",

Rheumatoid arthritis can cause mononeuritis multiplex which is a painful, asymmetrical, asynchronous sensory and motor peripheral neuropathy involving isolated damage to at least 2 separate nerve areas.
