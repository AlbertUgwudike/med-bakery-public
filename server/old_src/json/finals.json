This is Von-Willebrand disease, as suggested by the prolonged nosebleed, history of frequent epistaxis, and a normal FBC with a prolonged bleeding time and aPTT. As the patient is hemodynamically stable and their haemoglobin is normal, desmopressin and tranexamic acid should be used first-line to stop the bleeding. Desmopressin works by releasing vWF from endothelial cells, increasing vWF and factor VIII plasma concentration. Tranexamic acid prevents conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, inhibiting clot breakdown. \nC – This would be first-line if the patient was experiencing severe bleeding. However, he is hemodynamically stable with a normal haemoglobin. As such, desmopressin and tranexamic acid should be used first-line.  \nD – This would be second-line if the patient was experiencing severe bleeding.

A transvaginal ultrasound might be offered if there was a structural abnormality suspected to be the cause of menorrhagia. Some pointers in the history which may point to this is finding a bulky uterus. Here the uterus size is normal on examination. \nC – Although von-Willebrand disease is a good differential, a full blood count should be performed first to rule out any issue with the platelets. Furthermore, the history does not suggest other features of von-Willebrand disease, such as a positive family history or a long-standing history of bleeding. In this case, the patient only recently started noticing these symptoms. \nD – Correct. Based on the completely normal history beforehand and the patient’s age group, the most likely diagnosis here is ITP. Next steps should include assessment of platelets via an FBC and blood film. \nE – There are no features in the history suggesting infection, bacteraemia, or sepsis.

The FBC demonstrates an isolated thrombocytopenia  , and the clotting studies indicate impairment of primary haemostasis due to raised bleeding time. This narrows down the differentials to ITP and von-Willebrand disease. However, the aPTT is not raised, ruling out DIC, haemophilia and vWD as differentials. \nC – We would expect both PT and aPTT to be raised in DIC. Here they are normal. \nD – We would expect a raised aPTT in haemophilia and a normal bleeding time because haemophilia is an issue of secondary haemostasis. Here, the aPTT is normal. Furthermore, it is an X-linked recessive condition so is unlikely to be seen in females. \nE – Due to von-Willebrand factor shuttling around factor VIII, we would expect a raised aPTT in vWD."

However, with the history of haemophilia A, spontaneous haemarthrosis is more likely to be the case. Furthermore, the anterior draw test is negative. We would expect this to be positive in an ACL tear.  \nC – Correct. Spontaneous haemarthroses, large ecchymoses and intramuscular bleeds are common features for haemophilia A. \nD – In septic bursitis, we would expect the swelling to be present anterior of the knee rather than in the actual knee joint itself. Furthermore, we may also expect other features of infection like a fever. Here, his temperature is normal. \nE – Transient synovitis is a self-limiting condition characterised by the inflammation of the synovium following a precipitant (usually a preceding viral infection).

It should be noted, however, that there is a slightly higher risk of developing these antibodies with the use of plasma-derived factor VIII. \nC – This works in mild to moderate bleeds by releasing endothelial stores of von-Willebrand factor which increases plasma concentration of factor VIII. In acute and life-threatening bleeds, a bypassing agent such as factor VIIa can be used to bypass the intrinsic pathway and boost clot production via the extrinsic pathway. \nD – Vitamin K is useful in reversing the effects of warfarin as it inhibits the clotting factors II, VII, IX and X. However, it is not used in the management of haemophilia. \nE – Patients with haemophilia A have normal levels of factor IX so do not require this infusion.

However, oozing of blood, especially from more than 3 sites, with a clear trigger of major trauma, points strongly towards DIC. \nB – Correct. He has a clear trigger of trauma. He also has features of spontaneous bleeding and oozing from 3 different sites, suggesting he has DIC. A history of acute blood loss can also precipitate DIC due to loss of plasma and clotting factors during the acute haemorrhage. Other triggers include sepsis, obstetric emergencies, pancreatitis and haemotoxins. \nC – This is often a self-limiting condition following a viral illness. Although it may cause purpura and epistaxis, it should not come on as acutely. Furthermore, oozing of blood, especially from more than 3 sites, with a clear trigger of major trauma points strongly towards DIC. \nD – He is an inpatient so may have received heparin. Heparin can bind to platelet factor 4, activating them, and causing them to be destroyed in the spleen. However, this usually occurs around the 4-5th day of heparin therapy. This man has only been on heparin a day. Furthermore, oozing of blood, especially from more than 3 sites, with a clear trigger of major trauma points strongly towards DIC. \nE – TTP has a slow onset, occurring due to the improper cleavage of von-Willebrand factor. Although it may also lead to microthrombi formation, it usually presents with the classic pentad of anaemia, thrombocytopenia, fever, neurological dysfunction, and renal failure. Here, oozing of blood, especially from more than 3 sites, with a clear trigger of major trauma points strongly towards DIC."

This binds most commonly to rhesus antigen (or sometimes ABO or K antigen) at around 37 degrees. The bound erythrocytes are detected by splenic macrophages and removed from circulation via extravascular haemolysis. \\n \nB – Cold haemagglutinin disease is the most common type of cold AIHA. It is characterised by the absence of IgG and the presence of C3. In this, IgM antibodies bind to multiple red blood cells at lower temperatures (<25degrees) causing agglutination. \\n  \nC – This is a rare form of cold AIHA that is classically seen in children following a URTI. Again, it is characterised by the absence of IgG and the presence of C3. Here IgG is present. \\n \nD – This is a rare form of haemolytic anaemia characterised by intravascular haemolysis of erythrocytes due to abnormal complement binding and subsequent formation of membrane attack complexes on erythrocytes. It commonly presents with haemolytic anaemia, with increased haemolysis at night. This is not an immune-mediated process and thus a DAT test would be negative. \\n \nE – This is not immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia.

This, combined with the normocytic anaemia, systolic flow murmur, and positive DAT test, makes acute haemolytic crisis the most likely diagnosis. \\n \nB – This is again a good differential. However, a chest x-ray would show loss of normal lung markings as well as air in the pleural space. Here the chest x-ray is normal. This, combined with the normocytic anaemia, systolic flow murmur, and positive DAT test, makes acute haemolytic crisis the most likely diagnosis. \\n \nC – This is a good differential. However, it does not explain the jaundice. We may also expect to see characteristic signs of ischaemia or infarction on an ECG, including ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities (ST depression/elevation or T-wave inversion) or a new-onset left bundle branch block. The ECG here just shows sinus rhythm. This, combined with the normocytic anaemia, systolic flow murmur, and positive DAT test, makes acute haemolytic crisis the most likely diagnosis. \\n \nD – Correct. The presence of jaundice, combined with the normocytic anaemia, systolic flow murmur, and positive DAT test, makes acute haemolytic crisis the most likely diagnosis. In acute haemolysis, haemoglobin levels can drop dangerously low, meaning the cardiac output can no longer meet the perfusion demands of the body. Tachycardia is a compensatory mechanism (by increasing heart rate, we are able to pump haemoglobin around the body faster). However, if the tachycardia still cannot meet the perfusion demands, the heart may start to fail, leading to hypotension and shock. \\n \nE – Costochondritis refers to pain in the cartilage and rib joint in the chest.

In TTP, the clots formed are of hyaline-origin so fibrinogen levels are normal. Therefore, cryoprecipitate is not routinely used to treat this condition. \\n \nC – Correct. The most important and lifesaving step in the management of TTP is plasma exchange, which should be started within 4-8 hours of presentation. It works by removing anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies and replacing plasma ADAMTS13 enzymes. Treatment with this brings mortality down from 90% to 30%. \\n \nD – Steroids are routinely used adjuvant to plasma exchange.
