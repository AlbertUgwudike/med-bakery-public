Furthermore, we may also expect other features of infection like a fever. Here, his temperature is normal. E – Transient synovitis is a self-limiting condition characterised by the inflammation of the synovium following a precipitant (usually a preceding viral infection). This patient has no history of this. Furthermore, the history of haemophilia makes spontaneous haemarthrosis the most likely diagnosis.",

It should be noted, however, that there is a slightly higher risk of developing these antibodies with the use of plasma-derived factor VIII. C – This works in mild to moderate bleeds by releasing endothelial stores of von-Willebrand factor which increases plasma concentration of factor VIII. In acute and life-threatening bleeds, a bypassing agent such as factor VIIa can be used to bypass the intrinsic pathway and boost clot production via the extrinsic pathway. D – Vitamin K is useful in reversing the effects of warfarin as it inhibits the clotting factors II, VII, IX and X. However, it is not used in the management of haemophilia. E – Patients with haemophilia A have normal levels of factor IX so do not require this infusion.

On examination, you notice he is oozing blood from his cannulation sites, as well as his gums. He appears confused and drowsy, and appears to have a purpuric rash over his arms and legs. You notice his fingers look blue. His temperature is normal, but his pulse is 130bpm with a blood pressure of 85/60mmhg. ",

                "explanation": "A – Von-Willebrand disease is a disorder of primary haemostasis in which epistaxis and, rarely, purpura can be seen. However, oozing of blood, especially from more than 3 sites, with a clear trigger of major trauma, points strongly towards DIC. B – Correct. He has a clear trigger of trauma. He also has features of spontaneous bleeding and oozing from 3 different sites, suggesting he has DIC. A history of acute blood loss can also precipitate DIC due to loss of plasma and clotting factors during the acute haemorrhage. Other triggers include sepsis, obstetric emergencies, pancreatitis and haemotoxins. C – This is often a self-limiting condition following a viral illness. Although it may cause purpura and epistaxis, it should not come on as acutely. Furthermore, oozing of blood, especially from more than 3 sites, with a clear trigger of major trauma points strongly towards DIC. D – He is an inpatient so may have received heparin. Heparin can bind to platelet factor 4, activating them, and causing them to be destroyed in the spleen. However, this usually occurs around the 4-5th day of heparin therapy. This man has only been on heparin a day. Furthermore, oozing of blood, especially from more than 3 sites, with a clear trigger of major trauma points strongly towards DIC. E – TTP has a slow onset, occurring due to the improper cleavage of von-Willebrand factor. Although it may also lead to microthrombi formation, it usually presents with the classic pentad of anaemia, thrombocytopenia, fever, neurological dysfunction, and renal failure. Here, oozing of blood, especially from more than 3 sites, with a clear trigger of major trauma points strongly towards DIC.",

This is used to detect autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. While haemolysis is a key feature of DIC, the mechanism behind it is mechanical due to microthrombi deposition and intravascular shearing of cells. Since it is not an immune mediated process, the Coombs test is negative.  E – D dimer is a product of fibrin degradation, which is elevated DIC due to the rapid formation and breakdown of clots.

Clotting factors exist dissolved in the plasma. As such, replenishment of plasma via the means of FFP is first-line in replenishing all clotting factors. This includes fibrinogen. Only when this is not available or is contraindicated will cryoprecipitate or PCC be considered. General management includes supportive care and treating the underlying cause.
