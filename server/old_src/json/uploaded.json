It is thought that low levels of iron may lead to a disruption to this mechanism leading to restless leg syndrome. "

Given the family history, findings indicative of haemolysis and a negative DAT (suggesting the haemolysis is non-immune mediated) the most likely diagnosis is HS. \\n \nD – This is an autosomal recessive condition and thus, it is unlikely to be seen in this inheritance pattern.

In acute haemolysis, haemoglobin levels can drop dangerously low, meaning the cardiac output can no longer meet the perfusion demands of the body.

In TTP, the clots formed are of hyaline-origin so fibrinogen levels are normal. Therefore, cryoprecipitate is not routinely used to treat this condition. \\n \nC – Correct. The most important and lifesaving step in the management of TTP is plasma exchange, which should be started within 4-8 hours of presentation. It works by removing anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies and replacing plasma ADAMTS13 enzymes. Treatment with this brings mortality down from 90% to 30%. \\n \nD – Steroids are routinely used adjuvant to plasma exchange.
