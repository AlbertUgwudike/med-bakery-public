The history of mucosal bleeding and menorrhagia is indicative of impaired primary haemostasis. Initial investigations include ruling out thrombocytopenia with a full blood count. C – Hypothyroidism can be a cause of menorrhagia. However, nothing in this history is suggestive of hypothyroidism (e.g., weight gain, fatigue, or cold intolerance).  This history is more suggestive of impaired primary haemostasis so should be assessed, initially, with a full blood count.  D – The history of mucosal bleeding and menorrhagia is indicative of impaired primary haemostasis. Conditions like leukaemia may lead to thrombocytopenia, which could cause features of impaired haemostasis. As such, initial investigations should include ruling out thrombocytopenia with a full blood count. A bone marrow biopsy is only considered if the full blood count is suggestive of leukaemia.

C – Although the liver plays an important role in synthesis of clotting factors and thrombopoietin for platelets, von-Willebrand factor is produced in the endothelial cells.

Tranexamic acid is often used in the management of menorrhagia in women trying to conceive. It is an antifibrinolytic that inhibits the activation of plasminogen into plasmin. Desmopressin is often used in acute mild mucosal bleeding to release endothelial stores of von-Willebrand factor, which then increases factor VIII in the plasma. C – Correct.

As the patient is hemodynamically stable and their haemoglobin is normal, desmopressin and tranexamic acid should be used first-line to stop the bleeding.

It should be noted, however, that there is a slightly higher risk of developing these antibodies with the use of plasma-derived factor VIII. C – This works in mild to moderate bleeds by releasing endothelial stores of von-Willebrand factor which increases plasma concentration of factor VIII. In acute and life-threatening bleeds, a bypassing agent such as factor VIIa can be used to bypass the intrinsic pathway and boost clot production via the extrinsic pathway. D – Vitamin K is useful in reversing the effects of warfarin as it inhibits the clotting factors II, VII, IX and X. However, it is not used in the management of haemophilia. E – Patients with haemophilia A have normal levels of factor IX so do not require this infusion.

Bone marrow biopsies are used to diagnose a malignant infiltrative haematological condition such as leukaemia.

He also has features of spontaneous bleeding and oozing from 3 different sites, suggesting he has DIC. A history of acute blood loss can also precipitate DIC due to loss of plasma and clotting factors during the acute haemorrhage. Other triggers include sepsis, obstetric emergencies, pancreatitis and haemotoxins. C – This is often a self-limiting condition following a viral illness. Although it may cause purpura and epistaxis, it should not come on as acutely. Furthermore, oozing of blood, especially from more than 3 sites, with a clear trigger of major trauma points strongly towards DIC. D – He is an inpatient so may have received heparin. Heparin can bind to platelet factor 4, activating them, and causing them to be destroyed in the spleen. However, this usually occurs around the 4-5th day of heparin therapy. This man has only been on heparin a day. Furthermore, oozing of blood, especially from more than 3 sites, with a clear trigger of major trauma points strongly towards DIC. E – TTP has a slow onset, occurring due to the improper cleavage of von-Willebrand factor.

B – The thrombocytopenia may result in petechiae. C – Microthrombi in the kidney can lead to AKI and subsequent oliguria. D – Red cell fragments may appear in the urine, causing haemoglobinuria. E – Correct. The haemolysis that occurs in DIC is intravascular. As a result, the spleen does not play a big role in the haemolysis and does not enlarge. Another way to think about it is that DIC is an acute condition and, as such, the spleen also does not have enough time to enlarge. ",

Findings include a prolonged PT, aPTT and bleeding time.  C – Microthrombi in the kidneys can lead to AKI, which is reflected on the U&Es. D – Correct. This is used to detect autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. While haemolysis is a key feature of DIC, the mechanism behind it is mechanical due to microthrombi deposition and intravascular shearing of cells. Since it is not an immune mediated process, the Coombs test is negative.  E – D dimer is a product of fibrin degradation, which is elevated DIC due to the rapid formation and breakdown of clots. We would expect the levels to be markedly elevated.",

The depletion of the Intrinsic clotting factors leads to a prolonged aPTT. Since the cascade is highly active and produces high levels of fibrin, serum fibrinogen decreases. B – This would be the typical findings in warfarin toxicity.  C – This would be the typical findings in haemophilia. D – DIC classically shows prolonged PT, prolonged aPTT and low fibrinogen.

It is used as the second line to FFP which contains all of the clotting factors.  B – PCC contains the clotting factors II, VII, IX and X. It would partially resolve the coagulopathy and could be used if FFP is unavailable or patients could not have FFP due to fluid overload. Our patient has no signs of this. C – Correct. Clotting factors exist dissolved in the plasma. As such, replenishment of plasma via the means of FFP is first-line in replenishing all clotting factors. This includes fibrinogen. Only when this is not available or is contraindicated will cryoprecipitate or PCC be considered. General management includes supportive care and treating the underlying cause.   D – Although platelet transfusion does form part of the management of DIC, it is mainly considered if platelets drop below 50.  E – IV vitamin K is used in the treatment of overanticoagulation with warfarin. It is not used in DIC.",
