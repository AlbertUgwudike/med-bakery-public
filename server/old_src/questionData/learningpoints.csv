332,20/01/22,Neurology ,"Anterior strokes are divided up into TACI and PACI. A TACI is a triad of homonymous hemianopia, contralateral hemiparesis/hemisensory loss and higher cerebral dysfunction (broca's/wernicke's aphasia). A PACI is only 2 of the 3"
333,20/01/22,Neurology ,"Posterior circulation strokes (PoCS) include any one of the following - cranial nerve involvement and contralateral weakness, cerebellar features (vertigo, nystagmus, ataxia), gaze paresis, isolated homonymous hemianopia  or bilateral weakness/sensory loss"
334,20/01/22,Neurology ,"Lacunar infarcts occur due to a blockage of the perforating arteries near the basal ganglia. Features include isolated motor OR sensory deficit, isolated ataxia"
335,21/01/22,Neurology ,The first step in management of a suspected stroke includes stabilisation with ABCDE. This includes checking for glucose early and ruling out hypoglycaemia as a differential. 
336,21/01/22,Neurology ,A non-contrast CT head is the key diagnostic step in the diagnosis of an ischemic stroke. It should be performed ideally within 1 hour of presentation.
337,21/01/22,Neurology ,"CT features of an ischemic stroke include normal CT head, loss of grey white differentiation/diffuse hypoattenuation and sulcal effacement, dense MCA sign (hyperacute stroke) and loss of the insular ribbon sign."
338,21/01/22,Neurology ,"Patients presenting <4.5 hours of the onset of symptoms can be given thrombolysis with IV alteplase. If this is contraindicated, a thrombectomy may be considered if <6 hours since onset of symptoms. This may be combined with a thrombectomy if an MCA infarct is visualised on CT/MR angiography."
339,21/01/22,Neurology ,Hypertension in an acute setting may be physiological and thus does not need to be reduced unless a hypertensive emergency is present
340,21/01/22,Neurology ,"Effective inpatient management of a stroke involves swallowing assessment (ideally within 24 hours but no longer than 72 hours) nutrition delivery (if dysphagia is present, then initially via NG tube and the PEG tube for more permanent feeding) blood pressure and blood glucose optimisation."
341,21/01/22,Neurology ,LMWH is often not used in stroke patients due to risk of haemorrhagic transformation. Instead intermittent pneumatic compressions are used to prevent VTE
342,21/01/22,Neurology ,"Patients should receive 2 weeks of 300mg aspirin daily before being swapped to 75mg clopidogrel. If the patient cannot tolerate clopidogrel, aspirin + dipyridamole may be used as a substitute"
343,21/01/22,Neurology ,Patients with atrial fibrillation should receive 300mg aspirin for 2 weeks followed by a DOAC or warfarin
344,21/01/22,Neurology ,Strokes in younger patients more commonly occur due to haematological causes such as sickle cell disease or leukaemia
345,21/01/22,Neurology ,"Patients who have had a haemorrhage ruled out with a non-contrast CT  should be given 300mg aspirin. Do not give this before a CT head, as if the stroke is hemorrhagic this may perpetuate the bleeding"
346,21/01/22,Neurology ,"Complications of a stroke include aspiration pneumonia, shoulder subluxation, VTE, depression, falls, bowel and bladder incontinence, limb contracture as well as  hemorrhagic transformation"
347,22/01/2022,Haematology,"Supportive investigations include a FBC (most commonly shows leukocytosis; may show pancytopenia), and LDH (elevated)."
348,22/01/2022,Haematology,Most cases of CLL are asymptomatic and picked up incidentally via routine blood tests.
349,22/01/2022,Haematology,"Features of CLL include painless lymphadenopathy (due to B cell infiltration). Later features may include early satiety (due to splenomegaly), hepatomegaly, and features of pancytopenia."
350,22/01/2022,Haematology,"Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is a clonal proliferation of mature-appearing but functionally incompetent B lymphocytes, that have acquired mutations meaning they cannot undergo apoptosis."
351,22/01/2022,Haematology,CLL is the most common haematological malignancy in the Western world and is more common in the elderly.
352,22/01/2022,Haematology,Blood film characteristically shows smear cells.
353,22/01/2022,Haematology,CLL is most commonly managed using a wait and watch approach. Patients are followed up every 3-12 months for blood counts and clinical examination. Signs of CLL progression such as constitutional or pancytopenia symptoms are indications for treatment.
354,22/01/2022,Haematology,"Richter’s transformation is the transformation of CLL to an aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, characterised by rapid lymphadenopathy and new onset constitutional symptoms such as night sweats, weight loss and fevers. This diagnosis is confirmed with a lymph node biopsy."
355,22/01/2022,Haematology,"Complications of CLL include: Richter’s transformation, warm autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, and recurrent infections."
356,22/01/2022,Haematology,"Diagnostic investigations for CLL include flow cytometry, immunophenotyping and bone marrow biopsy."
357,22/01/2022,Haematology,Allogeneic stem cell transplant is the only curative management option. It is only considered if the patient is not suitable for other therapies or if they have not been responsive.
358,22/01/2022,Haematology,"Patients should be offered immune prophylaxis including: HiB vaccine, PCV pneumococcal vaccine (every 5 years), annual influenza vaccine and prophylactic antibiotics."
