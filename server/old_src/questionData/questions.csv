A terminal ileal resection involves removal of the terminal ileum (e.g. classically in Crohn’s disease).  As such, a terminal ileum resection is a big risk factor for B12 deficiency.","Correct. The ascending colon is involved in absorbing water from stools. However, it is not involved in the absorption of B12.","The use of PPIs can suppress stomach acid production, leading to less stomach acid production. Stomach acid is needed to release protein-bound B12.","A gastric bypass surgery bypasses the stomach, leading to less stomach acid being made. Stomach acid is needed to release protein-bound B12.","Pernicious anaemia is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency, and is associated with other autoimmune conditions such as vitiligo. The presence of anti-intrinsic factor antibodies leads to an intrinsic factor deficiency, meaning B12 cannot be absorbed in the terminal ileum.",2
2,,,,"5,8",d,, Which of the following is least associated with B12 deficiency?,Pica syndrome,Lemon-yellow tinge,Loss of vibration and proprioception,Dementia and depression,Gastric cancer,"Correct. Pica syndrome is the urge to eat strange, inedible things such as dirt or foam. This occurs due to iron deficiency, not B12 deficiency.",The lemon-yellow tinge occurs due to the haemolysis of macrocytic cells as they pass through the spleen.,The loss of vibration and proprioception senses can occur due to permanent nerve damage. This can result from the buildup of the neurotoxic substance methylmalonic acid,"Dementia and depression are common features of B12 deficiency, as well as loss of colour vision, due to nerve damage",Pernicious anaemia is associated with a 2-3 fold increase in the risk of gastric adenocarcinoma,1

3,active,11/01/2022,Haematology,8,a,"A 65-year-old lady with a history of Grave’s disease presents to the GP complaining of tingling in her feet and hands. She admits that she has been feeling significant more down recently and has been forgetting where she leaves her keys and to lock the door. \n
Examination shows that she has a lemon-yellow tinge on her skin, glossitis, and sub-conjunctival pallor. The doctor carries out a neurovascular examination. 
",What is he likely to find?,"Loss of vibration, proprioception, pain, and temperature senses in both arms and legs extending up to the torso",Unilateral loss of coordination in the legs and past-pointing,Loss of pain and temperature sensation in the arms in a cape-like distribution,"Loss of pain and temperature sensations on one leg, and motor, vibration, and proprioception in the other",Loss of vibration and proprioception senses in the feet and a positive Romberg’s test ,These are the characteristic findings in Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). GBS refers to a post-infective peripheral demyelinating polyneuropathy. It classically presents after an infective episode (e.g. GI campylobacter infection) which then progresses to loss of motor function and sensation. This pattern of function loss starts at the distal extremities and progresses proximally to affect the limbs. ,"This would suggest an isolated cerebellar lesion. The cerebellum is involved in balance and coordination, thus cerebellar lesions may present with dysdiadochokinesia (loss of rapid alternating movement), ataxia, nystagmus, intention tremor and staccato speech. This history is pointing more towards B12 deficiency.","This is the classical loss of sensation in syringomyelia, where the formation of a cyst in the spinal cord stretches the sensory fibres for pain and temperature sensation leading to a cape-like distribution of sensory loss.","This is the characteristic pattern for Brown-Sequard syndrome, also known as hemisection of the spinal cord. The patient classically gets ipsilateral loss of vibration and motor function and contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation. ","Correct. In B12 deficiency, there is degeneration of the posterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord, leading to loss of vibration and proprioception.",5

Which of the values would you expect to be reduced in the blood tests?",Homocysteine,Methylmalonic acid,Anti-intrinsic factor antibodies,Reticulocytes,"Anti-gastric parietal cells
","Homocysteine is reduced back to cystine by the action of B12. In a B12-deficient state, this can accumulate, increasing the risk of CVD.","Methylmalonic acid is a toxic product that is converted back to its non-toxic form by B12. In a deficient state, this can accumulate, leading to progressive and irreversible nerve damage.","This lady has a history of Grave’s Disease, meaning the most likely cause of her B12 deficiency is pernicious anaemia. This is characterised by anti-intrinsic factor antibodies.","Correct. Reticulocytes are typically low in B12 deficiency due to impaired red cell division, as a result of fewer available nucleotides.","This lady has a history of Grave’s Disease, meaning the most likely cause of her B12 deficiency is pernicious anaemia.

However, his maternal grandmother also had this diagnosis. His mother declined antenatal screening. The mum is told this is an inherited disease.",What inheritance does sickle-cell have?,Autosomal dominant,X-linked dominant,X-linked recessive,Autosomal recessive ,Mitochondrial,Sickle cell disease is an autosomal recessive condition. Examples of autosomal dominant conditions include hereditary spherocytosis and Marfan’s syndrome.,Sickle cell disease is an autosomal recessive condition. An example of an X-linked dominant condition is fragile X syndrome,Sickle cell disease is an autosomal recessive condition. Examples of X-linked recessive conditions include G6PD deficiency and Duchene’s muscular dystrophy.,Correct. Sickle cell is an autosomal recessive condition. Other examples of this inheritance pattern include cystic fibrosis and beta-thalassaemia.,Sickle cell is an autosomal recessive condition. Examples of mitochondrial diseases include MLEAS and Leigh syndrome.,4
4,,,,18,b,,How was the neonate likely diagnosed?,Routine blood film,Routine heel prick test,Routine haemoglobin electrophoresis ,Routine genetic testing ,Routine ultrasound abdomen,Blood film is not done routinely and would not show sickling at this early stage. This is due to the high level of HbF still present in the baby. The defective haemoglobin (HbS) starts to appear after 6 months of life and would not be present in the newborn.,Correct. All babies born in the UK are screened for sickle cell disease and this will pick up most cases. ,This test is not offered routinely.,A screening heel prick test will detect most cases.,"This test is not offered routinely. Due to high levels of HbF, there should not be any spleen findings this early on",2

Which of the following should she not be advised?,Keep the baby well hydrated,"The baby may be at a higher risk of infection, thus she should contact healthcare staff early if she suspects this",Keep the baby very cool as heat may bring about sickling,The child may need prophylactic antibiotics ,The child may require extra vaccinations such as the 5-yearly pneumococcal vaccine,Dehydration can precipitate a vaso-occlusive crisis.,Sickle cell patients are at a much higher risk of infection due to hyposplenism,"Correct. Cool, and especially cold, temperatures may trigger sickling.","Sickle cell patients are at a much higher risk of infection due to hyposplenism, thus need prophylactic antibiotics","Sickle cell patients are at a much higher risk of infection due to hyposplenism, thus they need more regular vaccines.",3
4,,,,15,e,,The mother would also like to know about complications of Sickle cell disease. Which of the following is not a complication? ,Strokes,Thrombotic events such as DVT/PE,Life-threatening infections ,Increased susceptibility to malaria,Aplastic crisis,"Strokes could occur due to sickling and occlusion of vessels supplying the brain. Over time, recurrent occlusions may lead to the formation of extensive collaterals vessels, which resemble a “puff of smoke” on MR angiogram. This is called Moya Moya disease.","Excessive haemolysis uses up endogenous nitrous oxide, leading to vasoconstriction, and thus, increases the risk of clotting.","Hyposplenism due to recurrent infarcts to the spleen may lead to life-threatening infections from meningococcal disease, as well as increased susceptibility to non-typhi salmonella.",Correct. Sickle cell disease and sickle cell traits are protective against malaria. This may explain its high prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa.,Infection with Parvovirus B19 may lead to transient red cell aplasia.  This is characterised by the absent formation of reticulocytes,4
5,active,11/01/2022,Haematology,16,a,"A 2-year-old boy who has recently migrated from India is brought into the doctors due to inconsolable crying. 
On examination, the child has white sclerae but significant sub-conjunctival pallor. He is tachycardic, dyspnoeic, lethargic and hypotensive, and has a central capillary refill time of 3 seconds. His abdomen appears distended, and he has splenomegaly on palpation. A full blood count shows marked anaemia, and there is presence of sickle cells on his blood film. 
",What is the most likely diagnosis?,Acute chest syndrome,Isolated painful crisis,"Aplastic anaemia
",Sequestration crisis,Haemolytic crisis,"Although sickle cell disease often does lead to haemolysis, the history would provide hints such as scleral icterus, dark urine or reticulocytosis on FBC.","Correct. This is the classical history for a sequestration crisis. The marked pallor and shock occur due to the occlusion of blood vessels leaving the spleen, leading to sequestration of blood and splenomegaly. The sequestering blood cells cannot circulate, leading to hypovolaemic shock.","Aplastic anaemia often results following a viral infection, especially parvovirus B19. There is no history here of a “slapped cheek appearance” or coryza, which would hint towards a passing viral infection. ","Correct. This is the classical history for a sequestration crisis.

First-line management is the treatment of shock via packed red cell transfusion.,"Splenectomy may only be considered if the episodes are recurrent. However, his most immediate management should focus on resuscitation and treatment of shock. Note, while splenectomy is effective at reducing future sequestration, it does leave the patient at a significantly higher risk of infections.","Correct. Immediate treatment of shock may include IV fluid boluses or, in the case of marked symptomatic anaemia, a packed red cell transfusion.","Hydroxycarbamide forms part of the management for chronic sickle cell disease. It works by increasing the available levels of foetal haemoglobin via the means of increased gamma chain production. The production of HbF leads to fewer painful episodes, due to less sickling. ","While IV fluid may initially be used to treat shock, oral fluid is not sufficient. Note that in the presence of marked anaemia, IV fluids may worsen the features further due to diluting the blood. As such, marked anaemia requires blood transfusions",3

He describes having repeated infections and states that his younger brother used to have episodes of extreme pain and sadly passed away due to meningitis.  On examination, he has a fever, respiratory rate of 28, bi-basal crackles throughout his lung fields, and a normal abdominal exam. A chest x-ray shows bilateral infiltrations.",What is the most likely diagnosis?,Vaso-occlusive crisis,Acute chest syndrome,Sequestration crisis,Haemolytic crisis,Aplastic anaemia,"An isolated vaso-occlusive crisis is more characterised by bone, back and abdominal pain, and often does not involve the chest.","Correct. This occurs due to an inflammatory response to sickle cells occluding pulmonary vessels. The inflammation and occlusion lead to hypoxic vasoconstriction, hypoxia and further sickling. This is extremely difficult to distinguish from pneumonia.","This is most commonly seen in children and not adults. Furthermore, we would expect a large spleen on palpation. ","Marked features of anaemia and haemolysis (jaundice, dark urine) are not present in the history or examination.","Aplastic anaemia often results following a viral infection, especially parvovirus B19.

Which condition may he be referring to?",Viral conjunctivitis,Cataracts,Diabetic retinopathy,Corneal clouding,Drug induced capsular opacification,"Incorrect. Though viral conjunctivitis is easily treatable and common, it is very unlikely to cause blindness. This is therefore not the correct answer","Correct. Cataracts are the leading cause of blindness worldwide, most commonly due to increasing age but there are many other factors involved such as a patient’s medical history.","Incorrect. Diabetic retinopathy is often due to poor control of diabetes and can be progressive. In many cases, it can lead to blindness which may be irreversible and is not always easily treatable.","Incorrect. Corneal clouding may occur secondary to a number of conditions such as keratitis, abrasion and due to damage from foreign bodies. Management will depend on the underlying cause but a corneal transplant can be done in late stages. However it is not the most common cause of reversible blindness.",Incorrect. Capsular opacification does not occur secondary to drugs and therefore this is not a known cause of eye pathology.,2

Whilst taking a history, the nurse asks him if he is currently taking a particular medication which may increase his risk of ophthalmic complications. Which additional medication might she be referring to?",Amlodipine,Atorvastatin,Glipizide,Desmopressin,Tamsulosin,"Incorrect. Although it may be useful to consider if the patient is on amlodipine for surgery (due to risk of hypotension), it is unlikely to be an issue for phacoemulsification since this is usually done under local anaesthetic as opposed to systemic. Additionally, this doesn’t answer the question which asks for ophthalmic complications.",Incorrect. Atorvastatin is not known to increase risk of eye complications following cataract surgery.,"Incorrect. Similar to amlodipine, stopping gliclazide may be helpful to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia, but again this doesn’t relate to any complications related to the eye","Incorrect. Desmopressin is not known to cause any ocular complications after cataract surgery. In fact, it may be used to treat complications such as bleeds following surgery in patients with Von Willebrand disease.","Correct. Tamsulosin (an alpha blocker) can cause the iris to become floppy by blocking alpha 1a receptors in the eye, making phacoemulsification harder to undertake. This is called Floppy Iris Syndrome. The other important group of drugs to be wary of are anticoagulants due to a higher bleeding risk.",5

Though cataract may lead to blindness, it is easily reversible and therefore this is not the most important reason","Correct. Amblyopia is defined as a ‘lazy eye’ in simple terms, and describes how the brain ignores input from the weaker eye, thereby the stronger eye is relied upon more greatly for vision. This can be an issue since it alters the depth of vision perception, and can be harder to reverse as the child grows.","Incorrect.

Investigations reveal an isolated thrombocytopenia.",What is the most likely diagnosis?,Haemolytic uraemic syndrome,Meningococcal septicaemia,Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia,Immune thrombocytopenic purpura,Henoch-Schoenlein purpura,"A - If this was HUS, we would expect a history of bloody diarrhoea, and anaemia with thrombocytopenia in the FBC. However, only an isolated thrombocytopenia is seen, which came on following a viral infection, making ITP the most likely diagnosis.","B - We would expect the child to be much more miserable, disoriented and withdrawn, with a fever and potential signs of shock. Here, the child is playful and oriented.","C - Although this is a good differential, we would expect a high white cell count as well as some other features of pancytopenia such as pallor or recurrent infection. The lack of organomegaly, as well as the isolated thrombocytopenia, makes ITP the most likely diagnosis.","D - Correct. The onset of bleeding following a viral infection, and confirmed isolated thrombocytopenia are the hallmarks of ITP.","E - This is a type of small vessel vasculitis.

A clotting screen reveals a prolonged aPTT,What is the most likely diagnosis?,Haemophilia A,Haemophilia B,Immune thrombocytopenic purpura,Von-Willebrand disease,Disseminated intravascular coagulation,"A - Correct. This baby had prolonged bleeding at his heel prick test, suggesting an underlying coagulopathy. Being male and having a maternal uncle with a bleeding disorder, with asymptomatic parents, suggests an X-linked recessive condition. The investigations demonstrate normal platelets and bleeding time, and a prolonged aPTT. This suggests a defect of the intrinsic pathway.

Which of the following is the mainstay prophylactic treatment?",Plasma-derived factor VIII,Recombinant factor VIII,Fresh frozen plasma,Cryoprecipitate,Activated factor VII,A - Plasma derived factor VIII is rarely used now due to the increased risk of blood-borne viral infections such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Recombinant factor VIII forms the first-line management of haemophilia A.,B - Correct. Recombinant factor VIII is first-line due to the reduced risk of viral infections such as Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease compared to plasma-derived factor VIII.,"C - FFP may be used in an emergency situation/acute bleeding episode if recombinant factor VIII is not available. An intravenous infusion helps to restore all clotting factors including factor VIII and fibrinogen. However, it is not used as prophylactic treatment.","D - Cryoprecipitate may be used in an emergency situation/acute bleeding episode if recombinant factor VIII is not available. It contains factor VIII, von-Willebrand factor and fibrinogen. However, it is not used as prophylaxis against acute bleeds.",E - Haemophilia is characterised by the deficiency of factor VIII in haemophilia A (the far more common type) and factor IX in haemophilia B (the rarer type). As such it is a disease of the intrinsic pathway. Factor VII is part of the extrinsic pathway and thus tends to be normal. As factor VII is not used prophylactically.,2

What is the most likely diagnosis?",Septic arthritis,ACL tear,Haemarthrosis,Septic bursitis,Transient synovitis,"A - With a history of haemophilia, haemarthrosis is more likely to be the diagnosis than septic arthritis. We can also see that his temperature is normal, whereas septic arthritis is often accompanied by fever and features of an infection.","B - An ACL tear may result in haemarthrosis. However, with the history of haemophilia A, spontaneous haemarthrosis is more likely to be the case. Furthermore, the anterior draw test is negative. We would expect this to be positive in an ACL tear.","C - Correct. Spontaneous haemarthroses, large ecchymoses and intramuscular bleeds are common features for haemophilia A.","D - In septic bursitis, we would expect the swelling to be present anterior of the knee rather than in the actual knee joint itself. Furthermore, we may also expect other features of infection like a fever. Here, his temperature is normal.","E - Transient synovitis is a self-limiting condition characterised by the inflammation of the synovium following a precipitant (usually a preceding viral infection).

16,,,,1,f,,"Should the child have a life-threatening bleeding episode, which of the following can be given as an alternative to factor VIII?",Factor VIIa,Plasma-derived factor VIII,Desmopressin,Vitamin K infusion,Recombinant factor IX,"A - Correct. Once antibodies have developed against factor VIII, bypassing agents such as factor VIIa can be used. This bypasses the intrinsic pathway by upregulating the extrinsic pathway, increasing clot production.","B - The antibodies target factor VIII regardless of whether it is plasma-derived or recombinant. It should be noted, however, that there is a slightly higher risk of developing these antibodies with the use of plasma-derived factor VIII.","C - This works in mild to moderate bleeds by releasing endothelial stores of von-Willebrand factor which increases plasma concentration of factor VIII. In acute and life-threatening bleeds, a bypassing agent such as factor VIIa can be used to bypass the intrinsic pathway and boost clot production via the extrinsic pathway.","D - Vitamin K is useful in reversing the effects of warfarin as it inhibits the clotting factors II, VII, IX and X. However, it is not used in the management of haemophilia.","E - Patients with haemophilia A have normal levels of factor IX so do not require this infusion. Furthermore, factor IX forms clots via the intrinsic pathway, which is inhibited due to the inhibition of factor VIII. As such, bypassing agents such as factor VIIa can be used.

Despite this, thrombocytopenia should be ruled out with a full blood count.",B - The history hints towards haemophilia in this patient. A clotting profile is very helpful in making the diagnosis and often shows a prolonged aPTT with a normal bleeding time.,"C - Trauma, such as a fracture, could cause haemarthrosis. As such, plain radiographs can be useful to rule this out.","D - Correct. At this stage, a bone marrow biopsy is not needed. First-line investigations such as a full blood count, clotting studies and liver function tests should be performed to rule out other clotting abnormalities. Bone marrow biopsies are used to diagnose a malignant infiltrative haematological condition such as leukaemia.","E - The features of short stature, a shield-shaped chest, webbing of the neck, and a wide carrying angle strongly suggests a chromosomal abnormality.

Which of the following best describes the genetic mutation?",Inversion of the X chromosome,Chromosomal nondisjunction,Robertsonian translocation,Inversion of the Y chromosome,Substitution reaction on chromosome 11,"A - Correct. Around half of the cases of severe haemophilia A occur due to a flip-tip inversion of the X chromosome. The long arm of chromosome X (containing the factor VIII gene) wraps around the short arm, placing the introns 1 and 22 next to each other, leading to a missense or nonsense mutation.",B - This is the mechanism behind Down syndrome.,"C - This is the mechanism behind Patau's syndrome, and rarely, Down syndrome.",D - The Y chromosome does not play a role in the mechanism of haemophilia A.,E - This is the mechanism behind sickle cell disease which is an autosomal recessive haemolytic anaemia.,1

They may also require IV fluids to replace fluids. He also requires a more thorough assessment which should be done after admission to hospital. Advising bedrest and ORS may lead to further kidney damage.","B - Although stool cultures will need to be performed, this should be done at the hospital. At the moment, the child requires assessment and treatment of underlying renal damage.","C - This will form part of the management. However, IV cannulation should be done at the hospital. Further to this, his peripheral access may be poor due to dehydration and diarrhoea and, as such, he may require more specialist input.","D - Correct.

However, oozing of blood, especially from more than 3 sites, with a clear trigger of major trauma, points strongly towards DIC.","B - Correct. He has a clear trigger of trauma. He also has features of spontaneous bleeding and oozing from 3 different sites, suggesting he has DIC. A history of acute blood loss can also precipitate DIC due to loss of plasma and clotting factors during the acute haemorrhage. Other triggers include sepsis, obstetric emergencies, pancreatitis and haemotoxins.","C - This is often a self-limiting condition following a viral illness. Although it may cause purpura and epistaxis, it should not come on as acutely. Furthermore, oozing of blood, especially from more than 3 sites, with a clear trigger of major trauma points strongly towards DIC.","D - He is an inpatient so may have received heparin. Heparin can bind to platelet factor 4, activating them, and causing them to be destroyed in the spleen. However, this usually occurs around the 4-5th day of heparin therapy. This man has only been on heparin a day. Furthermore, oozing of blood, especially from more than 3 sites, with a clear trigger of major trauma points strongly towards DIC.","E - TTP has a slow onset, occurring due to the improper cleavage of von-Willebrand factor.

This is a feature of vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia.,D - Iron is required for hair synthesis and thus this is associated with IDA.,"E - Restless leg syndrome is a common feature of IDA. The exact mechanism by which this occurs is unknown, however iron deficiency was associated with lower levels of iron in the dopamine-producing cells in the substantia nigra (a structure in the basal ganglia). Its main role is to produce dopamine which is involved in the initiation of voluntary movement as well as suppression of unwanted movement. It is thought that low levels of iron may lead to a disruption to this mechanism leading to restless leg syndrome.",3
20,,,,1,f,,What is the first-line treatment for iron deficiency anaemia in an otherwise healthy patient with no cardiovascular features?,IV iron,Packed red cell transfusion,IM iron,Oral ferrous sulfate,Erythropoietin,"A - Parenteral route should only be considered if the enteral route is ineffective. If she is newly diagnosed, NICE suggests oral iron first-line.",B - This would be the case if the patient had cardiovascular features such as heart failure. In stable patient's NICE recommends oral iron replacement as the first line.,"C - Parenteral route should only be considered if the enteral route is ineffective. If she is newly diagnosed, NICE suggests oral iron first-line.",D - Correct. NICE guidelines suggest PO iron sulfate 200mg TDS as first-line treatment for IDA.,E - This would stimulate erythrocyte production but would not treat the underlying iron deficiency.,4

The diagnosis is most likely iron deficiency anaemia as this is the most common cause of anaemia, and explains all the features such as glossitis, angular cheilitis and restless leg syndrome.","B - This would be the investigations considered for a suspected urinary tract infection. The patient is not complaining of any urinary symptoms (such as urgency, frequency and dysuria) and so is unlikely to have a UTI.","C - Although thyroid disorder (hyper- or hypothyroidism) can cause fatigue and weakness, it cannot explain the glossitis, angular cheilitis and restless leg syndrome so is unlikely to be the pathology here. Features of hyperthyroidism may be weight loss, heat intolerance and tremors whereas hypothyroidism may present with weight gain, cold intolerance and muscle weakness.",D - This would help to visualise the abdomen and some abdominal structures but not help diagnose the anaemia.,"E - Osteomalacia refers to a vitamin D deficiency, and is often characterised by fatigue and muscle weakness.

This, combined with the history, does not suggest a chest pathology so a chest X-ray is unlikely to indicate any chest pathology.","B - A microcytic anaemia has been found on initial investigations, so the cause of the microcytic anaemia must be investigated. In her age group in particular, it is imperative to rule out iron deficiency anaemia as this may be caused by malignancy. This is especially the case in post-menopausal women who will not be losing iron due to menstruation and thus an alternative cause for the iron deficiency should be explored.","C - Although a microcytic anaemia has been found, we are not aware of the cause of this. Even though iron deficiency is the most common cause of anaemia, other causes such as anaemia of chronic disease or sideroblastic anaemia should first be ruled out with iron studies.",D - Correct.

Given the family history, a negative DAT, and findings indicative of haemolysis, the most likely diagnosis is HS. \n","B - Although G6PD may present with haemolysis, it would be unusual to see this in a female patient as it is X-linked recessive. Furthermore, there is no history of a trigger, making HS the more likely diagnosis. \n","C - A DAT or direct antiglobulin test is an investigation which is used to determine whether suspected haemolytic anaemia is of immune origin. Given the family history, findings indicative of haemolysis and a negative DAT (suggesting the haemolysis is non-immune mediated) the most likely diagnosis is HS. \n","D - This is an autosomal recessive condition and thus, it is unlikely to be seen in this inheritance pattern. Since autosomal recessive conditions are masked by the dominant allele, the disease often skips a generation.

Other than his dermatitis herpetiformis, he is otherwise well with no past medical history.",What is the most likely diagnosis?,Beta-thalassaemia minor,Hereditary spherocytosis,Sickle cell anaemia,G6PD deficiency,Gilbert's syndrome,"A - Beta thalassaemia minor is often an asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic haemolytic anaemia. This man has more severe features, with a trigger of dapsone, making G6PD deficiency the most likely diagnosis. \n","B - Hereditary spherocytosis is a good differential however often in HS, the patient is asymptomatic or has mild anaemic features. In this case, his ethnicity as well as a trigger of dapsone make G6PD deficiency the most likely diagnosis. HS is often asymptomatic or may have mild features of haemolysis. \n","C - His ethnicity does support the diagnosis of sickle cell. However, the presence of a trigger (dapsone) makes G6PD deficiency the most likely diagnosis. Also, if sickle cell was the cause, other features such as bone pain, chest pain or neurological features may also be present. \n","D - Correct. His ethnicity as well as a clear trigger of dapsone (an oxidant drug), makes G6PD deficiency the most likely diagnosis \n","E - Gilbert's syndrome is a cause of jaundice due to the deficiency of the UDP glucuronyl transferase enzyme (an enzyme needed to conjugate bilirubin in the liver).

23,,,,1,b,,The man is suspected to have G6PD deficiency. Which one of the following relatives would you expect to also suffer from the condition?,His mother,His maternal uncle,His father,His paternal aunt,His sister,"A - G6PD deficiency is an X-linked recessive condition. Although he will inherit the defective X chromosome from his mother, she will be asymptomatic due to the functional X chromosome masking the dysfunctional one. \n","B - Correct. G6PD deficiency is an X-linked recessive condition. The dysfunctional X chromosome is inherited from the maternal side. Since his maternal uncle will also have 1 chromosome (XY), the dysfunctional X chromosome cannot be masked, leading to G6PD deficiency. \n","C - G6PD deficiency is an X-linked recessive condition. He will inherit the Y chromosome from his father, not the X. \n","D - G6PD deficiency is an X-linked recessive condition. He will inherit the Y chromosome from his father, not the X.

23,,,,1,c,,Which of the following would you not expect to find in the man's investigations?,Presence of schistocytes on blood film,Bite cells,Heinz bodies,Reticulocytes,Raised LDH,"A - Correct. Schistocytes or helmet cells result from the shearing of red blood cells and are mainly seen in microangiopathic haemolytic anaemias. Examples of these include DIC, haemolytic uraemic syndrome and TTP, where the deposition of microthrombi leads to shearing and cutting of erythrocytes. \n",B - Bite cells are often seen in G6PD deficiency due to splenic macrophages removing sections of the damaged cells. \n,C - Heinz bodies are inclusion bodies of damaged haemoglobin and are characteristically seen in G6PD deficiency. \n,D - G6PD deficiency is a haemolytic anaemia so reticulocytosis typically occurs to compensate for the loss of haemoglobin. \n,E - G6PD deficiency is a haemolytic anaemia and LDH is typically raised during haemolysis. LDH is an intracellular enzyme found inside of erythrocytes. Haemolysis leads to increased LDH release. \n,1

She says that this has been going on over the last few months but has gradually been getting worse. She also complains about her hands turning pale and painful whenever she goes outside in the cold. She is otherwise well. On examination, she has mild scleral icterus and yellowing of her palms and feet. Abdominal palpation reveals mild splenomegaly. Her blood pressure is 130/92mmHg and her pulse is 84bpm. Investigations reveal a positive DAT, with the presence of C3 and the absence of IgG.

Furthermore, warm AIHA is characterised by the presence of IgG antibodies which are absent here. \n","B - Correct. The absence of IgG, along with features worsened by the cold (e.g., Raynaud's phenomenon), makes cold haemagglutinin disease the most likely diagnosis. \n","C - PCH most commonly presents in children with features of haemolytic anaemia following a URTI. Although it is also C3 positive and worsened by cold temperature, the absence of a trigger such as an URTI makes this diagnosis unlikely. \n","D - This is a rare form of haemolytic anaemia characterised by intravascular haemolysis of erythrocytes due to abnormal complement binding, and subsequent formation of membrane attack complexes on erythrocytes. It commonly presents with haemolytic anaemia with increased haemolysis at night. Since this is not an immune-mediated process, a DAT test would be negative. \n","E - This is not immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia. Instead, it is the most common inherited membraneopathy in Northern Europeans. Since it is not immune-mediated process, a DAT test would be negative. \n",2
24,,,,1,b,,Which of the following is not a likely finding on the blood film?,Clumping of red cells,Polychromasia,Increased reticulocyte count,Schistocytes,Spherocytes,"A - Clumping of red cells is often seen on a blood film (in cold AIHA) because the film is often kept at room temperature. At these lower temperatures, there is optimum binding with IgM antibodies which causes the cells to clump together. This gives it the name cold autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. \n",B - Polychromasia refers to red cells undergoing different stages of development. It is often present in excessive haemolysis due to the compensatory mechanism of increased haematopoiesis. \n,C - Reticulocytosis is often present in excessive haemolysis due to the compensatory mechanism of increased haematopoiesis. \n,"D - Correct. Schistocytes refer to red cell fragments that result from intravascular haemolysis. This is not a feature of CHAD or Warm AIHA as the majority of the haemolysis is extravascular in nature. This could potentially be seen in PCH if a Donath-Landsteiner test is performed. However, this has not been done in this instance. \n E - Spherocytes may be seen in AIHA. \n",,4
24,,,,1,c,,Which of the following is unlikely to form part of her next investigations?,Bone marrow biopsy,CT chest abdomen and pelvis,"HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C screen",ANA and Anti-dsDNA screen,Hepatitis A and hepatitis E screen,"A - A bone marrow biopsy is often done in patients >60y/o, who have no identifiable trigger for CHAD, to look for bone marrow infiltration. Conditions such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma as well as CLL can both lead to CHAD and thus, should be investigated further. Serum electrophoresis is carried out alongside this to detect paraproteins. \n","B - Solid tumour malignancies can lead to CHAD. Thus, this should be ruled out. \n","C - Infections, especially HIV, Hep B and Hep C, can lead to CHAD and should be ruled out. \n","D - Other autoimmune diseases such as SLE and connective tissue diseases can lead to AIHA. As such, these should be screened for with ANA testing. \n","E - Correct. Hepatitis A and E are the main acute forms of hepatitis which present with obvious and highly apparent jaundice rather than mild jaundice. There is often a travel history or a history of consuming seafood, which is absent here. Furthermore, hepatitis A and E are not associated with AIHA. \n",5
24,,,,1,d,,"Screening for secondary causes is negative, and a diagnosis of primary CHAD is made. What is her management?",IV methylprednisolone,IV immunoglobulins,Oral prednisolone,Rituximab,Azathioprine,"A - IV methylprednisolone can be used in an emergency setting, especially in those who are haemodynamically unstable or in need of a blood transfusion. It is not used in the management of stable CHAD. \n","B - IVIg can be used in the emergency management of warm AIHA. However, since the agglutination is caused by IgM, IVIg is not very useful in the management of CHAD. \n","C - Oral prednisolone is first-line in the management of warm AIHA. However, CHAD is less responsive to prednisolone. As such, rituximab is first-line. \n","D - Correct. CHAD is less responsive to traditional steroids or immunosuppressants such as azathioprine or mycophenolate. As such, the British Society of Haematology suggest rituximab as first-line. This is a monoclonal antibody directed at the CD20 receptor of B-cells, leading to B-cell depletion. \n","E - CHAD is less responsive to traditional steroids or immunosuppressants such as azathioprine or mycophenolate.

There is evidence of haemolysis, with the presence of jaundice and splenomegaly. As such, this is most likely haemolytic anaemia. In this, we would expect a raised reticulocyte count as the body tries to compensate for the haemolysis via increased haematopoiesis. \n","B - Correct. The history suggests anaemia is present due to the new-onset fatigue, weakness, and dizziness. There is evidence of haemolysis, with the presence of jaundice and splenomegaly. As such, this is most likely haemolytic anaemia. In this, serum haptoglobin binds to the free haemoglobin, reducing its level in the blood. \n","C - The history suggests anaemia is present due to the new-onset fatigue, weakness, and dizziness. There is evidence of haemolysis, with the presence of jaundice and splenomegaly. As such, this is most likely haemolytic anaemia. In this, we would expect an elevated LDH which is released during red cell breakdown. \n","D - The history suggests anaemia is present due to the new-onset fatigue, weakness, and dizziness. There is evidence of haemolysis, with the presence of jaundice and splenomegaly. As such, this is most likely haemolytic anaemia. In this, we would expect a raised bilirubin due to increased heme breakdown. \n","E - The history suggests anaemia is present due to the new-onset fatigue, weakness, and dizziness. There is evidence of haemolysis, with the presence of jaundice and splenomegaly. As such, this is most likely haemolytic anaemia. In this, we would expect normocytic anaemia because while the number of erythrocytes are low, their composition is normal. \n",2

25,,,,1,c,,Which of the following investigations would allow the diagnosis of autoimmune haemolysis?,Haptoglobin,Coombs' test,LDH,Urine haemosiderin,FBC,"A - Haptoglobin is low in haemolysis as it binds free haemoglobin. However, it does not distinguish between immune and non-immune mediated destruction. \n",B - Correct. The Coombs' test (also known as the DAT test) is the diagnostic test for immune haemolysis. \n,"C - LDH is elevated due to increased cell turnover in haemolysis. However, it does not distinguish between immune and non-immune mediated destruction. \n","D - Urine haemosiderin may be raised due to increased haemolysis. However, it does not distinguish between immune and non-immune mediated destruction. \n","E - A full blood count can confirm anaemia and show reticulocytosis, suggesting haemolysis.

What is the most likely diagnosis?,Warm autoimmune haemolytic anaemia,Cold haemagglutinin disease,Paroxysmal cold haemoglobinuria,Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria,Hereditary spherocytosis,A - Correct. Warm AIHA is characterised by the presence of the IgG antibody. This binds most commonly to rhesus antigen (or sometimes ABO or K antigen) at around 37 degrees. The bound erythrocytes are detected by splenic macrophages and removed from circulation via extravascular haemolysis. \n,"B - Cold haemagglutinin disease is the most common type of cold AIHA. It is characterised by the absence of IgG and the presence of C3. In this, IgM antibodies bind to multiple red blood cells at lower temperatures (&lt;25degrees) causing agglutination. \n","C - This is a rare form of cold AIHA that is classically seen in children following a URTI. Again, it is characterised by the absence of IgG and the presence of C3. Here IgG is present. \n","D - This is a rare form of haemolytic anaemia characterised by intravascular haemolysis of erythrocytes due to abnormal complement binding and subsequent formation of membrane attack complexes on erythrocytes. It commonly presents with haemolytic anaemia, with increased haemolysis at night. This is not an immune-mediated process and thus a DAT test would be negative. \n","E - This is not immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia.

In these cases, high dose oral steroids are first-line. \n","B - IVIg may be used to rapidly stop haemolysis in those who are haemodynamically unstable or transfusion dependent. In this case, the patient is stable with a normal pulse and blood pressure. In these cases, high dose oral steroids are first-line. \n","C - Correct. In this case, the patient is stable with a normal pulse and blood pressure so high dose oral steroids are first-line. \n",D - This is used second-line to oral steroids if patients do not respond within 21 days. \n C - This is used third-line if patients have failed to respond to both prednisolone and rituximab. \n,,3

On examination, she is clearly jaundiced. Palpation of the abdomen reveals splenomegaly, and auscultation of the chest reveals a systolic flow murmur. Her blood pressure is 88/58mmHg and her pulse is 120bmp. Initial investigations reveal a normocytic anaemia, a positive DAT test, normal serum troponin, sinus rhythm on an ECG, and a normal chest x-ray.",What is the most likely diagnosis?,Pulmonary embolism,Pneumothorax,Myocardial infarction,Acute haemolytic crisis,Costochondritis,"A - This is a very good differential given the clinical picture. However, a pulmonary embolism would not explain the jaundice. This, combined with the normocytic anaemia, systolic flow murmur, and positive DAT test, makes acute haemolytic crisis the most likely diagnosis. \n","B - This is again a good differential. However, a chest x-ray would show loss of normal lung markings as well as air in the pleural space. Here the chest x-ray is normal. This, combined with the normocytic anaemia, systolic flow murmur, and positive DAT test, makes acute haemolytic crisis the most likely diagnosis. \n","C - This is a good differential. However, it does not explain the jaundice. We may also expect to see characteristic signs of ischaemia or infarction on an ECG, including ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities (ST depression/elevation or T-wave inversion) or a new-onset left bundle branch block. The ECG here just shows sinus rhythm. This, combined with the normocytic anaemia, systolic flow murmur, and positive DAT test, makes acute haemolytic crisis the most likely diagnosis. \n","D - Correct. The presence of jaundice, combined with the normocytic anaemia, systolic flow murmur, and positive DAT test, makes acute haemolytic crisis the most likely diagnosis. In acute haemolysis, haemoglobin levels can drop dangerously low, meaning the cardiac output can no longer meet the perfusion demands of the body. Tachycardia is a compensatory mechanism (by increasing heart rate, we are able to pump haemoglobin around the body faster). However, if the tachycardia still cannot meet the perfusion demands, the heart may start to fail, leading to hypotension and shock. \n",E - Costochondritis refers to pain in the cartilage and rib joint in the chest.

26,,,,1,b,,Which of the following are unlikely to form part of the emergency management?,IV methylprednisolone,Oral prednisolone,Blood transfusion,Folate supplementation,Keeping the room warm,"A - This is an emergency situation as the patient is haemodynamically unstable. In this emergency stage, IV methylprednisolone is often used to control haemolysis.\n","B - Correct. This is an emergency situation as the patient is haemodynamically unstable. As such, IV methylprednisolone, as well as consideration for plasma exchange (and IVIg in warm AIHA) form the main steps in preventing further haemolysis. Oral prednisolone is used in haemodynamically stable patients. \n","C - The patient has clear signs of cardiovascular collapse due to a systolic flow murmur, hypotension, and tachycardia as a result of the haemolysis. Initially, IV resuscitation fluids may be used to meet the perfusion demands for a short time. However, a blood transfusion will likely be needed. \n",D - Folate supplementation forms part of the supportive measures to support haematopoiesis. The replacement of folate would allow for nucleotide synthesis and production of reticulocytes to replace the erythrocytes lost during haemolysis. \n,"E - Before a diagnosis of warm or cold AIHA can be made, patients should be kept warm to prevent an exacerbation of cold AIHA. \n",2

What is the most appropriate step?,Infuse IV resuscitation fluids until the sample is ready,Infuse erythropoietin,"Transfuse ABO, Rhesus and K matched blood",Perform immediate splenectomy,Set up a maintenance fluid bag until blood is ready,"A - Although IV resuscitation may be attempted initially, repeated IV boluses can dilute the blood further, worsening the anaemia and subsequently causing heart failure. As such, ABO, rhesus and K-matched blood should be infused in an emergency because these are what the antibodies are most commonly directed against. \n","B - Erythropoietin is the hormone that triggers haematopoiesis. This process takes some time to work whereas the patient needs urgent treatment due to cardiovascular compromise. As such, ABO, rhesus and K-matched blood should be infused in an emergency because these are what the antibodies are most commonly directed against. \n","C - Correct. In this emergency situation, the patient is showing clear signs of haemodynamic compromise and as such 4-6 hours may be too long to wait. Most commonly IgG antibodies target ABO, Rhesus and K antigens which are much quicker to crossmatch. As such once this is done, this can then be transfused into the patient. \n","D - Although a splenectomy may be considered, this is usually an option if other methods such as IV methylprednisolone, IVIg or plasma exchange have failed. In this acute scenario, the patient is experiencing haemodynamic compromise and requires urgent correction of their haemoglobin. \n",E - Maintenance fluids main role is to keep the patient hydrated and is often used in haemodynamically stable patients who are kept nil by mouth (either due to pre-op or swallowing difficulties). As the patient in this scenario is haemodynamically unstable and requires a blood transfusion. \n,3

Which of the following is unlikely to form part of her further management?,Erythropoietin,Folate supplementation,Bisphosphonates,Vitamin D3 and calcium,Low molecular weight heparin,"A - Correct. Erythropoietin is the hormone that triggers haematopoiesis. In haemolytic anaemia, EPO levels are already likely to be high. As such, EPO does not form part of the supportive management of AIHA. \n","B - Folate supplementation is often given to support the process of haematopoiesis as folate is required for DNA synthesis, replication and cell division. \n","C - She is an elderly lady who has been prescribed corticosteroids, making her very high risk for osteoporosis. The Royal College of Physicians recommends any person >65-years-old who has been placed on a glucocorticoid to have bisphosphonates for bone protection. \n","D - She is an elderly lady who has been prescribed corticosteroids, making her very high risk for osteoporosis and as such, may have vitamin D3 and calcium supplementation to support bone health. \n","E - As this patient is admitted as an inpatient, she is at increased risk of a thrombotic event due to a likely period of immobility.

Given the family history, a negative DAT, and findings indicative of haemolysis, the most likely diagnosis is HS. \n","B - Although G6PD may present with haemolysis, it would be unusual to see this in a female patient as it is X-linked recessive. Furthermore, there is no history of a trigger, making HS the more likely diagnosis. \n","C - A DAT or direct antiglobulin test is an investigation which is used to determine whether suspected haemolytic anaemia is of immune origin. Given the family history, findings indicative of haemolysis and a negative DAT (suggesting the haemolysis is non-immune mediated) the most likely diagnosis is HS. \n","D - This is an autosomal recessive condition and thus, it is unlikely to be seen in this inheritance pattern. Since autosomal recessive conditions are masked by the dominant allele, the disease often skips a generation.

27,,,,1,c,,Which of the following results would not fit the clinical picture?,Increased reticulocytes,Presence of spherocytes on blood film,Low serum haptoglobin,Raised LDH,Presence of pappenheimer bodies on blood film,"A - In haemolytic anaemia, we expect a high reticulocyte count as a compensatory mechanism. \n",B - Spherocytes is the classical finding on a blood film in HS. \n,"C - The free haemoglobin released from haemolysis will bind to haptoglobin, reducing serum haptoglobin. \n",D - Increased cell turnover due to haemolysis leads to increased LDH. LDH is an enzyme found inside erythrocytes. Haemolysis and red cell breakdown lead to a release of LDH. \n,"E - Correct. This would suggest an underactive spleen. In most cases of HS, the spleen is either normal or overactive. Therefore, hyposplenism is not a feature. \n",5

27,,,,1,e,,She is discharged with folic acid supplementation and follow up. She presents a few years later with severe right upper quadrant pain which comes and goes in waves. An ultrasound of the biliary tract visualises a stone in the cystic duct. What type of stone is this most likely to be?,Calcium oxalate,Homocysteine,Pigment bilirubin stone,Cholesterol stone,Triple phosphate stone,"A - This is the most common form of a kidney stone, not a gallstone. \n","B - This is a rare condition seen in the autosomal recessive condition homocystinuria. In a patient with HS, the excess bilirubin is likely to form pigment stones. \n","C - Correct. In a patient with HS, the excess bilirubin (produced during the process of haemolysis) is likely to form pigment stones. \n","D - This is the most common type of gallstone. However, her younger age combined with the splenomegaly and haemolytic anaemia suggests a pigment gallstone is more likely. \n",E - This is a rare type of kidney stone which is often formed in a life-threatening case of pyonephrosis. It is not associated with HS. \n,3
27,,,,1,f,,Which of the following steps could reduce her risk of having pigment gallstones?,Red cell transfusion,Splenectomy,Folic acid supplementation,Glucocorticoids,"Avoidance of fava beans, ciprofloxacin, or nitrofurantoin",A - Red cell transfusion may be used in a haemolytic crisis however will not actively stop the haemolysis process. \n,B - Correct. Splenectomy will reduce haemolysis because the spleen would no longer be present to haemolyse the cells. This means less bilirubin production and fewer pigment gallstones. \n,"C - Folic acid may be used to replenish the loss of folate due to excessive haemolysis, and facilitate reticulocyte production. However, it will not prevent haemolysis. \n",D - HS is not an autoimmune disease so steroids do not play a role. Steroids are immunosuppressants which can help to dampen the immune response and thus treat autoimmune conditions. \n,"E - This is recommended for people with G6PD, not HS. Exposure to oxidative stress such as fava beans, ciprofloxacin or nitrofurantoin leads to haemolysis in G6PD due to a deficiency of the enzyme. This is not the case in HS, where haemolysis occurs as a result of a structural defect on erythrocyte membranes. \n",2

Her blood tests reveal a mild anaemia with marked microcytosis.",What most likely caused the death in utero for the foetus?,Beta-thalassaemia minor,Alpha-thalassaemia minor,Beta-thalassaemia major,Alpha-thalassaemia major,Sickle cell disease,"A - Beta thalassaemia minor presents with mild anaemia or is asymptomatic, with patients only being diagnosed incidentally. Majority of the foetus' haemoglobin will be HbF which does not contain the beta globin protein. Since this protein is not expressed in the foetus, hydrops fetalis is not associated with beta thalassemia. \n","B - Alpha thalassaemia minor presents with mild anaemia or is asymptomatic, with patients only being diagnosed incidentally. This is because in alpha thalassaemia minor, at least 2 of the original 4 genes are present, which will compensate for the 2 genes lost during the mutation. \n","C - This is a good differential to have, however hydrops rarely occur in beta-thalassaemia major. This is because most of the haemoglobin in-utero is HbF which is composed of 2 alpha and 2 gamma chains and thus unaffected. It is not until 6 months of life until adult haemoglobin containing the (beta globin) starts to take over leading to symptoms. \n",D - Correct. Alpha-thalassaemia major with 4 deletions can lead to hydrops fetalis due to the inability to form foetal haemoglobin. \n,"E - This is a good differential to have, however hydrops rarely occur in sickle cell disease. This is because most of the haemoglobin in-utero is HbF which is composed of 2 alpha and 2 gamma chains and thus unaffected. The abnormality seen in sickle cell disease occurs due to a mutation in the gene coding for the beta-globin protein. Since this is not expressed until 6 months of life, hydrops foetalis is not associated with sickle cell disease. \n",4

In HbH disease, only 3 of the 4 globin chains are affected, thus some alpha chains will be produced (preventing hydrops fetalis). \n","B - Correct. HbH involves the deletion of 3 alpha globin chains, resulting in moderate to severe symptoms. \n",C - Most patients with HbH disease develop symptoms of moderate haemolytic anaemia early on in life. \n,D - This is the disease profile of sickle cell disease. \n,E - This is the disease profile for G6PD deficiency. \n,2

Beta-thalassaemia major is characterised by microcytic anaemia with a disproportionately low MCV. \n,"B - Beta thalassaemia is a type of microcytic anaemia. Causes of normocytic anaemia include anaemia of chronic disease, acute blood loss and bone marrow failure. \n",C - Beta thalassaemia is a type of microcytic anaemia. A high MCV may be seen in megaloblastic anaemia such as haematinic deficiency (B12 and folate) or non-megaloblastic anaemia such as chronic liver disease. \n,D - Beta thalassaemia is a type of microcytic anaemia. A borderline MCV may be seen in iron deficiency anaemia whereas beta-thalassaemia characteristically leads to a marked microcytosis. \n,E - Beta thalassaemia is a type of microcytic anaemia.

Cobalamin is also known as vitamin B12. Its deficiency causes macrocytic megaloblastic anaemia. This occurs due to impaired nucleotide synthesis, leading to a reduction in cell division. \n","D - Pregnancy causes macrocytic non-megaloblastic anaemia. Note that pregnancy can also cause folate deficiency, however, folate is routinely supplemented with the use of folic acid during pregnancy. \n",E - Cholecalciferol is vitamin D and has no role in hematopoiesis.

The presence of a palpable spleen, isolated rise in bilirubin and lack of pruritus suggests haemolytic anaemia as the cause of her presentation. \n","B - Although this may present with jaundice, we would expect pruritus and a raised ALP in primary biliary cirrhosis. The presence of a palpable spleen, isolated rise in bilirubin and lack of pruritus suggests haemolytic anaemia as the cause of her presentation.\n","C - This may present with jaundice and isolated hyperbilirubinaemia. The presence of splenomegaly suggests haemolysis as the cause. Gilbert's syndrome is characterised by transient jaundice and hyperbilirubinemia, due to the deficiency of the UDP glucuronosyltransferase enzyme, which leads to an inability to conjugate bilirubin. \n","D - Acute kidney injury (AKI) is not usually associated with haemolytic anaemia. AKI may be a complication of microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, characterised by issues with clotting and bleeding, which is not the case here. \n","E - Correct.

She says her mother has had a similar episode of this. On examination, she has scleral icterus, splenomegaly and sub-conjunctival pallor. The doctor suspects haemolytic anaemia.",Where is the most likely site of erythropoiesis in this lady?,"Long bones, axial skeletons, liver and spleen",Primarily long bones and axial skeleton,Primarily axial skeleton,Primarily long bones,Primarily liver and spleen,A - This is the site of haematopoiesis in foetuses aged 2-6 months. \n,B - This is the site of haematopoiesis in a child. \n,"C - Correct. In adults, hematopoiesis occurs in the bones of the axial skeleton. \n","D - In adults, hematopoiesis occurs in the bones of the axial skeleton, not the long bones. \n","E - In adults, hematopoiesis occurs in the bones of the axial skeleton, not the liver and spleen. \n",3
33,,,,1,b,,Which of the following investigations would not be appropriate to order at this stage?,Direct Coombs test,Reticulocyte count,Serum haptoglobin,Bone marrow biopsy,Blood film,A - This is part of the haemolysis screen and rules out autoimmune haemolysis. \n,"B - This is part of the haemolysis screen and is raised in haemolysis, as a compensatory mechanism to replace haemolysed erythrocytes. \n",C - This is part of the haemolysis screen and is reduced in haemolysis because free haemoglobin binds to haptoglobin. \n,D - Correct. The history here is not indicative of a malignant condition. There are clear signs of haemolysis so a haemolysis screen should be carried out first. This does not include bone marrow biopsy. \n,E - This is part of the haemolysis screen and may reveal specific abnormalities such as bite cells or Heinz bodies depending on the cause of haemolysis. \n,4
33,,,,1,c,,Her blood tests reveal a raised reticulocyte count. Which hormone is primarily responsible for this and where is it produced?,Renin in the kidney,Erythropoietin in the liver,Thrombopoietin in the liver,Erythropoietin in the kidney,Thymic stromal lymphopoietin in the epithelial cells,"A - Renin is involved in the maintenance of blood pressure, controlling renal filtration, and sodium regulation. It is not involved in haematopoiesis. \n",B - Erythropoietin does cause haematopoiesis but is produced in the kidneys. \n,C - Thrombopoietin causes thrombopoiesis (formation of megakaryocytes). \n,D - Correct. EPO is released by the kidneys and leads to erythropoiesis. \n,E - Thymic stromal lymphopoietin causes lymphopoiesis (formation of white cells). \n,4
33,,,,1,d,,Further investigations reveal she has hereditary spherocytosis. Where in the body is the site of destruction for these cells?,The spleen,The bone marrow,The lungs,The small vessels,The aortic valve,"A - Correct. In both normal states and in hereditary spherocytosis, circulating erythrocytes are destroyed by splenic macrophages or Kuffper cells of the liver after 120 days of circulation. Here, this is evidenced by the splenomegaly. \n","B - In hereditary spherocytosis, the majority of the haemolysis occurs in the spleen. In diseases where there is erythrocyte membrane damage (e.g., in thalassaemias and G6PD deficiency), erythrocytes may be destroyed while leaving the bone marrow. \n",C - The lungs do not play a large role in haemolysis. \n,D - This occurs in diseases of microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia such as DIC or TTP. \n,E - This is a type of macroangiopathic haemolytic anaemia that we may expect in metallic heart valves. \n,1
34,active,11/01/2022,Haematology,1,a,"A 35-year-old lady is admitted to A&E following a seizure. On assessment, she appears very confused and cannot provide a history. However, her husband tells you she has been complaining of a headache for the past 2 days and has been experiencing diarrhoea for a week. On examination, she has a purpuric rash across her legs. Her temperature is 38.5C, her heart rate is 110bpm and her blood pressure is 120/92mmHg. She has sub-conjunctival pallor and scleral icterus, and bedside urine dipstick shows presence of protein and blood.",What is the most likely diagnosis?,Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura,Haemophilia A,Disseminated intravascular coagulation,Henoch-Schoenlein purpura,"A - ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion characterised by an isolated thrombocytopenia. Often, the only symptoms are that of impaired primary haemostasis (purpuric rash, nose bleeds, gum bleeds). However, this lady has the pentad of features characteristic of TTP: fever, haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neurological features, renal failure. \n","B - Correct. This lady has the characteristic pentad of fever, haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neurological features, and lastly renal failure, making TTP the most likely diagnosis. \n","C - Haemophilia A is an X-linked dominant condition. Although not impossible, it would be extremely unlikely to present in a lady. Furthermore, the presence of a purpuric rash suggests an issue with primary haemostasis whereas haemophilia affects secondary haemostasis. In this case, the patient also has the pentad of fever, haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neurological features, and renal failure. \n","D - This is a good differential for TTP. However, the absence of spontaneous oozing of blood and presence of the classic pentad (fever, haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neurological features and renal failure), make TTP a much more likely diagnosis. \n","E - Henoch-Schoenlein purpura is an autoimmune IgA small vessel vasculitis. Although a purpuric rash is seen here, in HSP, it is classically over the back of the legs and buttocks. Abdominal pain and renal failure may also feature. This lady has the pentad of fever, haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neurological features and renal failure, making TTP the more likely diagnosis. \n",2
34,,,,1,b,,Which of the following explains the pathogenesis behind this condition?,Deficiency of factor VIII,Deficiency of von-Willebrand factor,Deficiency of UDP-glucosyltransferase enzyme,Deficiency of ADAMTS13,Deficiency of antithrombin,A - This is the pathogenesis of haemophilia A. \n,B - This is the pathogenesis of von-Willebrand disease. \n,"C - This is the pathogenesis of Gilbert's syndrome. This is a genetic condition that causes transient, self-limiting jaundice during times of physiological stress. \n","D - Correct. TTP occurs due to the congenital or acquired deficiency of the ADAMTS13 enzyme, which is worsened by a trigger such as infection or pregnancy. \n","E - This is the pathogenesis of antithrombin deficiency, which presents with thrombotic events. Antithrombin levels are normal in TTP. \n",4
34,,,,1,c,,Which of the following is the function of ADAMTS13?,Bind to exposed collagen,Cleave large multimers of von-Willebrand factor,Combine with other proteins to form the membrane attack complex,Shuttle factor VIII around the blood,Activate the extrinsic pathway of clotting cascade,A - This is the normal action of Von-Willebrand factor. \n,"B - Correct. In its deficiency, large Von-Willebrand multimers reacts with platelets leading to microthrombi formation in small arteriole. \n",C - This is the function of the complement proteins of the complement cascade. \n,D - This is the normal action of von-Willebrand factor. \n,E - This is the normal action of tissue factor. \n,2
34,,,,1,d,,Her investigations confirm normocytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia. What is likely to be seen on her blood film?,Pappenheimer bodies,Howell-Jolly bodies,Pencil cells,Schistocytes,Bite cells,"A - Pappenheimer bodies are seen in sideroblastic anaemia, haemolytic anaemia or sickle cell disease. \n","B - Howell-Jolly bodies are classically seen in hyposplenism or asplenia. In TTP, often the spleen is hyperactive, leading to splenomegaly. \n",C - Pencil cells are classical in iron deficiency anaemia. This may be suggested by a microcytic anaemia but this patient has normocytic anaemia. \n,"D - Correct. Microthrombi are deposited in the small arterioles in TTP. As erythrocytes pass through them, they are sheared into red cell fragments, forming schistocytes. \n",E - Bite cells are classical in G6PD deficiency. \n,4
34,,,,1,e,,What is likely to be found on her clotting studies?,"Normal PT, normal aPTT normal fibrinogen","Prolonged PT, prolonged aPTT and low fibrinogen","Normal PT, prolonged aPTT and normal fibrinogen","Prolonged PR, prolonged aPTT and normal fibrinogen","Prolonged PT, normal aPTT and normal fibrinogen","A - Correct. ADAMTS13 usually cleaves large reactive multimers of vWF into small, stable ones. This enzyme is deficient in TTP so clots form as a result of the highly reactive, large vWF binding to platelets, causing platelet activation and aggregation. These clots are of hyaline origin rather than fibrin so secondary haemostasis is preserved. Thus, PT, aPTT and fibrinogen are normal. \n","B - These findings are associated with DIC. The main difference between the TTP and DIC relates to the clots formed. In DIC, the clots are fibrin based (whereas they are hyaline based in TTP). This uses up all the clotting factors and fibrinogen, leading to prolonged PT and aPTT.",C - These are the findings seen in Von-Willebrand disease. aPTT is prolonged as a result of increased factor VIII clearance secondary to deficiency or faulty vWF.,"D - ADAMTS13 usually cleaves large reactive multimers of vWF into small, stable ones. This enzyme is deficient in TTP so clots form as a result of the highly reactive, large vWF binding to platelets, causing platelet activation and aggregation. These clots are of hyaline origin rather than fibrin so secondary haemostasis is preserved. Thus, PT, aPTT and fibrinogen are normal.",E - These are the findings seen in warfarin use.,1
34,,,,1,f,,Which of the following findings is the patient unlikely to have?,Elevated LDH,Elevated reticulocytes,Decreased haptoglobin,Positive Coombs' test,Elevated bilirubin,A - LDH is present in red blood cells. Haemolysis leads to the LDH being released into the plasma so LDH is elevated in TTP. \n,B - Haemolysis in TTP leads to an elevated reticulocyte count as a compensatory mechanism. \n,C - Haemolysis in TTP leads to a higher amount of free haemoglobin being released into the serum. Haptoglobin binds to free haemoglobin so will be reduced when measured. \n,"D - Correct. The haemolysis that occurs in TTP is a non-immune mediated process. It occurs as erythrocytes are sheared due to the microthrombi in blood vessels. Therefore, a Coombs' test would be negative. \n","E - Haemolysis occurs in TTP, leading to increased bilirubin levels. \n",4
34,,,,1,g,,Further investigations reveal raised urea and creatinine. Which of the following can be used to provide a definitive diagnosis?,Blood film,Clotting studies,Serum LDH,Von-Willebrand factor antigen assay,ADAMTS13 activity assay,"A - A blood film is helpful in indicating a haemolytic process is occurring because it can be used to visualise schistocytes. However, it is not diagnostic as there are other causes of haemolysis. Other differentials for TTP (e.g., HUS, DIC) would also cause schistocytes to form. \n","B - Clotting studies are helpful if haemolysis is suspected. If findings are normal, they can be used to rule out a very important differential, DIC. However, it is not diagnostic as differentials such as HUS may present similarly and have the same findings. \n","C - Serum LDH is helpful if haemolysis is suspected as it is elevated in excessive haemolysis. LDH is found in red blood cells and is released into the serum during haemolysis. However, it is not diagnostic as the other differentials for TTP (HUS and DIC) and other causes of haemolysis would also cause this. \n",D - This is used to detect a von-Willebrand factor deficiency and is not used to diagnose TTP. It would be used to diagnose von-Willebrand disease. \n,"E - Correct. TTP is caused by the deficiency of ADAMTS13. This is most commonly due to antibody formation against this enzyme. In TTP, the ADAMTS13 activity assay would be reduced. \n",5
34,,,,1,h,,The patient is able to maintain her own airway. She is oxygenating at 98% and is haemodynamically stable. What is the most important step in her definitive management?,Fresh frozen plasma infusion,Cryoprecipitate infusion,Plasma exchange,IV methylprednisolone,Red cell transfusion,A - FFP is a potential option if plasma exchange is likely to be delayed or is not available. It is not the definitive management. The definitive management of TTP involves plasma exchange which should be started within 4-8 hours of presentation. \n,"B - This is sometimes used in DIC to replenish fibrinogen levels in DIC. In TTP, the clots formed are of hyaline-origin so fibrinogen levels are normal. Therefore, cryoprecipitate is not routinely used to treat this condition. \n","C - Correct. The most important and lifesaving step in the management of TTP is plasma exchange, which should be started within 4-8 hours of presentation. It works by removing anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies and replacing plasma ADAMTS13 enzymes. Treatment with this brings mortality down from 90% to 30%. \n","D - Steroids are routinely used adjuvant to plasma exchange. This helps to suppress the immune system to prevent further ADAMTS13 deficiency. However, the most important step of management at this stage is plasma exchange to remove anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies and replace plasma ADAMTS13 enzymes. \n","E - This may be used to treat anaemia, especially if the patient is having features of cardiac compromise. This is primarily a supportive measure and does not actually treat the TTP. A plasma exchange is required to treat TTP by removing anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies and replacing plasma ADAMTS13 enzymes. \n",3
34,,,,1,i,,Which aspect of this patient's history indicates the use of rituximab?,Abdominal pain,Proteinuria,Fever of 38.5,Seizures,Purpuric rash,A - Abdominal pain is a common feature of TTP and occurs due to microthrombi occluding small arterioles in the gut. The British Society of Haematology states that rituximab should be used in those with neurological or cardiac involvement as these are associated with high mortality. \n,B - Proteinuria is a common feature of TTP and occurs due to microthrombi occluding small arterioles in the kidneys. The British Society of Haematology states that rituximab should be used in those with neurological or cardiac involvement as these are associated with high mortality. \n,C - Fever is a common feature of TTP and may occur alongside other non-specific features such as malaise and arthralgia. The British Society of Haematology states that rituximab should be used in those with neurological or cardiac involvement as these are associated with high mortality. \n,D - Correct. The British Society of Haematology states that rituximab should be used in those with neurological or cardiac involvement as these are associated with high mortality. \n,E - Purpuric rashes are a common feature of TTP and occur due to thrombocytopenia. The British Society of Haematology states that rituximab should be used in those with neurological or cardiac involvement as these are associated with high mortality. \n,4
34,,,,1,j,,Which of the following would indicate cardiac involvement?,Raised troponin,Raised LDH,Raised creatinine,Raised bilirubin,Raised reticulocytes,"A - Correct. A rise in troponin suggests myocardial injury, most commonly due to coronary artery occlusion. This is a sinister feature and is associated with high mortality. The British Society of Haematology states that rituximab should be used in those with neurological or cardiac involvement because they are associated with high mortality. \n","B - Raised LDH is a common finding in TTP and occurs due to haemolysis. LDH is found inside red blood cells and when haemolysed, is released into the serum. It is not related to cardiac involvement. \n",C - Raised creatinine is a common finding in TTP and is often found alongside raised urea. This occurs due to microthrombi in the kidneys leading to renal failure. \n,D - Raised bilirubin is a common finding in TTP and occurs due to haemolysis. It is a breakdown product of red blood cells so would be raised in increased haemolysis. It is not related to cardiac involvement. \n,E - Reticulocytosis is a common finding in TTP and occurs secondary to haemolysis as a compensatory mechanism to replace the haemolysed red blood cells. It is not related to cardiac involvement. \n,1
34,,,,1,k,,Which of the following are contraindicated in her management?,Haemodialysis,Platelet transfusion,Red cell transfusion,Folate supplementation,Low molecular weight heparin and 75mg aspirin,A - Haemodialysis may be used in renal failure. \n,B - Correct. Platelets are contraindicated in TTP because platelet count and quality is not affected. A platelet transfusion would cause thrombocytosis in the patient and significantly increase risk of thrombosis. \n,"C - This may be used to treat the anaemia, especially in those with cardiac compromise. \n","D - Red cell transfusion can be used to help support haematopoiesis, particularly in severe anaemia. \n","E - Patients suffering from TTP are at a high risk of clotting. As such, in patients with platelets > 50 x 109, the British Society of Haematology indicates the use of LMWH as thromboprophylaxis and 75mg aspirin to protect against arterial events. \n",2
34,,,,1,l,,Which of the following is not associated with TTP?,Post-partum,HIV,Hepatitis B,Graves' disease,Preceding viral illness,A - Around 20-25% of cases of TTP occur in the post-partum period or the late stages (third trimester near term) of pregnancy. \n,B - HIV is commonly associated with TTP. Patients often have a HIV screen post diagnosis. \n,C - Both hepatitis B and C are associated with TTP. Patients often have a hepatitis B and C screen post diagnosis.\n,D - Autoimmune diseases such as Graves' disease and SLE are associated with TTP. \n,"E - Correct. Preceding viral illness is a feature of acute ITP, in children. It is not associated with TTP. \n",5

Her medications include amlodipine, bendroflumethiazide, ramipril, aspirin and verapamil.",Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Foreign body,Conjunctivitis,Blepharitis,Anterior uveitis,Ocular lymphoma,"Incorrect. Though a foreign body may present with symptoms of grittiness and soreness, it does not typically lead to morning symptoms of the eyes feeling stuck together nor eyelash crusting. The patient does not have any risk factors of foreign bodies entering the eye either, such as working with metals etc.","Incorrect. Conjunctivitis can cause a red and painful eye with eyelid swelling, but crusting is not typically a feature of this condition. Additionally, her past medical history suggests that blepharitis may be the more likely diagnosis.","Correct. This patient has many of the features of blepharitis, and her previous diagnosis of Sjogren’s makes this more likely secondary to dry eyes.","Incorrect. Like some of the other options, anterior uveitis is an important cause of red eye, and is important to consider given her diagnosis of Sjogren’s. However, there is no mention of other symptoms such as floaters and her vision is normal, making this option less likely. Also, crusting and the eyes feeling sticky in the morning is not associated with uveitis.","Incorrect. Though Sjogren’s can increase the risk of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, it does not typically present with symptoms like these, and instead may present as worsening vision with floaters and constitutional symptoms of cancer, such as weight loss.

Staphylococcus infections are much more common in females, accounting for 80% of all cases. However, blepharitis from other causes is equally seen in both genders.","Correct. Staphylococcus infections are much more common in females, accounting for 80% of all cases. However, blepharitis from other causes is equally seen in both genders.",Incorrect. Staphylococcus blepharitis typically results in anterior blepharitis,"Incorrect. Diabetes can lead to reduced immunity and therefore patients are more prone to all forms of acute infection, including blepharitis.","Incorrect. This is not a known association, and blepharitis is not typically seen in neonates.",2
35,,,,38,c,,Which of the following is most strongly associated with posterior blepharitis?,Staphylococcus infection,Dermatitis herpetiformis,Strep epidermidis infection,Lupus erythematosus,Seborrheic dermatitis,Incorrect. Infection generally leads to anterior blepharitis,Incorrect. Dermatitis herpetiformis is a skin condition associated with Coeliac’s disease and does not cause blepharitis.,Incorrect. Infection generally leads to anterior blepharitis,Incorrect. Lupus is rarely associated with blepharitis as an entity on its own,Correct. Seborrheic dermatitis (and other skin conditions such as rosacea) are strongly associated with posterior blepharitis secondary to meibomian gland dysfunction.,5

ACE inhibitors are not known to cause blepharitis.,Incorrect. Aspirin and other anticoagulant drugs are not associated with blepharitis.,Incorrect. Calcium channel blockers are not known to cause blepharitis.,"Correct. Diuretics (especially thiazide diuretics) can reduce lacrimation and dry out the eyes, increasing the risk of blepharitis, since the tear film is an important component in reducing infection and inflammation.

Clinically, acute subdural haematomas are difficult to distinguish from epidural haematomas and would require a CT head to confirm the lesion. As a classical exam presentation, epidural haematomas present with altered consciousness following injury (typically, loss of consciousness), followed by a lucid interval (return of (near) baseline neurological function), followed by clinical deterioration. However, subdural haematomas may present with a period of normal neurological function at the onset of injury, but neurological decline is progressive and continuous.","Incorrect. Subarachnoid haemorrhages do not present with a lucid interval as above. These patients will typically present with a sudden-onset, intense “thunder-clap-like” headache, neck stiffness and muscle aches alongside a decreased/decreasing consciousness.","Correct. This patient presents with a lucid interval which occurs due to the venous shunting reflex following a highly expansile haematoma (i.e., EDH compresses the brain and vasculature). The trauma on the side of the head is suggestive of pterion damage which is a common cause of middle meningeal artery, causing EDH.","Incorrect. Cerebral contusions do not present with a lucid interval. Instead, they often present with headaches, confusion, sleepiness, dizziness, seizures and loss of consciousness.","Incorrect.  Diffuse axonal injury does not present with a lucid interval. It presents similarly to contusions and concussions e.g., headaches, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, and loss of consciousness. ",3

Although this structure can be affected in EDH, particularly if there's an associated frontal bone fracture, the middle meningeal artery is most often damaged in EDH.","Incorrect. The superior sagittal sinus can also be damaged during high impact trauma, causing a venous EDH. It would present on a CT head at the vertex of the brain. However, the middle meningeal artery is most often damaged in EDH.","Incorrect. The sphenoparietal sinus can also be damaged in traumatic injuries and cause a venous EDH. It would present on the lateral cranial fossa on a CT head. However, the middle meningeal artery is most often damaged in EDH.",Correct. The middle meningeal artery is the structure that is most commonly affected in EDH. It is usually associated with damage to the pterion but can also be damaged in a base of skull fracture.,Incorrect. The sigmoid sinus is rarely affected in EDH. It would be seen in the posterior aspect of the cranial fossa on a CT head.

Although you may choose to have ECG leads placed as part of your workup, it would not be the first thing to do in this scenario.",Incorrect. An urgent CT head is vital but it is not the first thing you would do for this patient as they need to be assessed and stabilised with an ABCDE approach before they can undertake a scan.,"Incorrect. A fast MRI may be done (in the absence of a CT scanner) as an initial investigation but this patient, who has just presented, needs to be assessed and stabilised with an ABCDE approach first.","Correct. This is the most important thing to do for patients presenting to A&E, especially in  trauma situations. ABCDE stands for - airway, breathing, circulation, disability and exposure. These are in the order of potential compromise that cause mortality quickest, thus the need to approach patients in this way.","Incorrect.

You suspect there may be raised intracranial pressure.,Which of the following red flag symptoms would you not expect in this patient?,Hypotonia,Progressive drowsiness,Pupil dilation,Abnormal posturing in response to pain,"Cushing’s triad (bradycardia, hypertension, respiratory depression)",<p>Correct. This would not be present as a result of a raised ICP. Hypotonia is a lower motor neuron symptom and would not be expected to be seen in the context of an EDH. </p> A raised ICP is important to recognise due to the risk of herniation. Brain herniation results in a significantly raised risk of complications and mortality.,Incorrect. This is a red flag for raised ICP as a raised ICP is known to cause an altered consciousness and progressive drowsiness.,"Incorrect. Pupil dilation is an important red flag for raised ICP. It usually results due to a transtentorial uncal herniation pressing on the efferent oculomotor (CN3) fibres, resulting in a surgical 3rd nerve palsy.","<p> Incorrect. Abnormal posturing i.e. decorticate (abnormally flexed) / decerebrate (abnormally extended) posturing is a red flag for raised ICP. </p> <p> Decorticate is thought to arise due to an overall reduction in corticospinal signals as the cortex is damaged significantly. The red nucleus in the midbrain which signals primitive locomotion is normally effectively inhibited due to corticospinal activity but without the activity, abnormal flexion occurs. </p> <p> Decerebrate is thought to arise due to extensive higher cerebral function loss. Higher cerebral function inhibits abnormal extensor movement that is normally signalled by the vestibular nucleus (communicating with spinal nerves through the vestibulospinal tract). Without higher cerebral function, abnormal extension occurs. <p>","<p> Incorrect. Cushing’s triad occurs as a reflex to a raised ICP. Cushing's triad occurs as a reflex. A rising ICP means that diffuse pressure will start to press on the vasculature supplying structures of the brain i.e. thus reduced Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP). CPP = Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) - ICP. </p> Thus as a reflex to decreased cerebral perfusion, systemic hypertension occurs through sympathetic stimulation. Continued systemic hypertension is thought to trigger baroreceptors in the aortic arch and/or the intracranial vagus nerve (CN9) causing parasympathetic activation and bradycardia.

In patients with GCS&lt;8 or rapidly declining GCS, they lose the ability to maintain their airways. This option would not be appropriate as it does not reach as far as the ET (endotracheal) tube.",Incorrect. This is contraindicated in the context of an anticipated worsening of airway compromise and thus cannot be used in this case due to the low GCS,"Incorrect. This is often done initially to open the airway and allow better observation, however with a dropping GCS, this cannot support the airway.",Correct. This is the most appropriate choice for this patient given his GCS score. “8 to intubate”. Tracheal intubation is defined as placement of a cuffed endotracheal (ET) tube below the vocal cords.

You would raise the position to lower ICP as gravity will shift blood away from the brain,Correct. You would NOT give normal saline as it does not treat the raised ICP. This is because isotonic saline does not encourage fluid shifts and ICP is treated by shifting fluid away from CSF ,Incorrect. You would give IV mannitol which is an osmotic diuretic used to decrease ICP. Diuresis will encourage a fluid shift away from the CSF.,"Incorrect. You would give hypertonic saline which will allow for movement of fluid away from the brain, decreasing ICP.","Incorrect. Hyperventilation is shown to decrease ICP. This is because cerebral blood flow is largely dependent on PaCO2.

Alongside this she has a sloughy coating on her tongue which raises the suspicion of a candidal infection. All these factors point towards the diagnosis of chronic immunosuppression which raises the suspicion of HIV. Although parvovirus can cause transient red cell aplasia it is not known to cause immunosuppression. Features of parvovirus include slapped cheek syndrome.,The patient is a chronic IV drug user and admits to sharing needles. Alongside this she has a sloughy coating on her tongue which raises the suspicion of a candidal infection. All these factors point towards the diagnosis of chronic immunosuppression which raises the suspicion of HIV.,Coxsackievirus is a human enterovirus and is one of the most common causes of viral meningitis. It is not known to cause immunosuppression or fungal meningitis.,Arbovirus is an endemic virus in the US and mainland Europe known to cause viral meningitis. It is not known to cause immunosuppression.,"HTLV1 virus is associated with the development of adult T cell lymphoma, a form of aggressive adult T cell lymphoma. The history of IV drugs and sharing needles strongly suggests the presence of HIV.",2
37,,,,126,d,She consented for HIV testing and found to be positive. ,Which of the following organisms is most likely to have caused this episode of fungal meningitis?,Mucormycosis,Cryptococcus neoformans,Coccidiomycosis,Aspergillus,Candida,Incorrect. This is a rare cause of fungal meningitis and is not necessarily associated with HIV. Mucormycosis is seen as a post-COVID complication in endemic areas e.g. India.,Correct. Cryptococcus neoformans is the most common cause of fungal meningitis and is especially seen in patients with HIV/AIDS but also other causes of immunosuppression e.g. immunosuppressive medications used after an organ transplantation.,Incorrect. Coccidiomycosis is rare and is endemic to North america. It is unlikely to be seen in this patient as there is no history of visiting north america.,Incorrect. Aspergillus is a very rare cause of meningitis and is thus not the likeliest cause of fungal meningitis in this patient.,Incorrect. Candidal meningitis is seen in patients with recent neurosurgical procedures e.g. ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement. This patient doesn't have any exposure to neurosurgical procedures and is thus much more unlikely to have candidal meningitis.,2
37,,,,127,e,"Cryptococcus antigen is found on CSF PCR, confirming her diagnosis.",What is the best step in her management?,IV cefotaxime + IV gentamicin,IV mebendazole,IV amphotericin B and IV fluconazole,IV amoxicillin + IV cefotaxime,IV acyclovir,"Incorrect. These are antibiotics and would not be used in the management of fungal meningitis. Furthermore, even in bacterial meningitis, the use of gentamicin is not common practice.","Incorrect. This is an anti-parasitic medication used to treat threadworm, hookworm and roundworm infections. They have no role to play in the management of fungal meningitis and would not be used.","Correct. This is the regime most commonly used in fungal meningitis patients, especially patients with cryptococcal meningitis. This induction therapy is typically prescribed for 2 weeks in hospital, then the amphotericin B is stopped and oral fluconazole is given for the maintenance and prevention of worsening.",Incorrect. These are antibiotics and these are used as empirical antibiotics in patients &lt;3months old and >50 years old where there is no known aetiology. They have no role to play in the management of fungal meningitis.,Incorrect. Aciclovir is an antiviral medication used to treat severe herpes infections. It has no role to play in the management of fungal meningitis.,3
37,,,,128,f,She is started on IV amphotericin and IV fluconazole.,Which of the following is most likely to be seen on this patient?,Hypokalemia,Polycythemia,Hypermagnesemia,Hyperkalemia,Metabolic alkalosis,"Correct. Amphotericin B is highly nephrotoxic. It causes renal arteriole vasoconstriction thus causing a reduced eGFR. It also damages the distal convoluted tubule and causes a pathological permeability of the cell membranes. This causes potassium and magnesium to go into the lumen to be urinated out, leading to hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. Polyuria can also occur due to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus as amphotericin B causes a resistance to ADH.",Incorrect. A normochromic normocytic anaemia can be seen as a side effect of amphotericin B as it is thought to be toxic to the bone marrow and suppress EPO production in the kidneys. A polycythemia would not be seen,Incorrect. A hypomagnesemia will be seen as a result of amphotericin use. Amphotericin is an important cause of hypomagenesemia as it is one of 3 drugs to cause major renal loss of magnesium (the other 2 being cyclosporin and cis-platin).,Incorrect. A hypokalemia will be seen as amphotericin B causes potassium wasting from the kidneys due to damage to the distal tubular cells.,"Incorrect. Amphotericin B causes a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis due to a type 1 renal tubular acidosis. This is where hydrogen ions go down the concentration gradient from the lumen into the distal tubule cells, leading to acid accumulation and acidosis. This can occur due to the increased permeability of the cell membranes caused by amphotericin B.",1
38,active,11/01/2022,Ophthalmology,52,a,"<p> A 39-year-old female presents with bilateral red eyes and a burning sensation for the past few days. She also complains of a feeling that something is stuck in her eyes when she blinks and has noticed that light appears to cause pain. As a result, she has been sitting in a darker environment at home. </p>
On examination the patient appears to have swollen eyelids and redness to the sclera. There doesn’t appear to be any other lumps present around the eyes and there is no visible pus or discharge. On further examination, there is some erythema noted around the patient’s cheeks and small telangiectasia. 
","Given the likely diagnosis in this patient including any underlying causes, which of the following may be most helpful as the next step?",Refer to rheumatology,No further investigations necessary,Full blood count including autoimmune screen,Swabs the eyes and cheeks for bacterial infection,Take a skin biopsy,"Incorrect. Though her rash may suggest systemic lupus erythematosus, there is no indication to refer her for rheumatology in this case, where the most likely diagnosis is blepharitis secondary to rosacea. Indications of referral to ophthalmology, however, may include blurred vision and significant pain (suggesting corneal disease), rapid onset visual loss, suspected orbital cellulitis, or ineffective treatment at primary care level.","Correct. No further investigations are necessary in this case, as the vignette is suggestive of a diagnosis of posterior blepharitis secondary to rosacea. The malar rash with telangiectasia, and no other systemic features is less suggestive of autoimmune disease.","Incorrect. A full blood count and autoimmune screen may be suggested in autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren’s, rheumatoid arthritis and SLE which may all be causes of blepharitis. However, this patient does not have features of any of these conditions such as joint pain, mouth ulcers or parotid swelling.","Incorrect. There is no indication of swabbing this patient’s eyes, even if infection was suggested. NICE recommends only swabbing blepharitis if it is recurrent, severe, or the patient is immunocompromised.","Incorrect. Biopsies are not warranted in either blepharitis or rosacea, unless there is asymmetry suggestive of dermatological malignancy, which is not the case here.",2
38,,,,53,b,,Which of the following is the most suitable management for this patient’s blepharitis?,Topical Chloramphenicol drops,Topical betamethasone drops,No further treatment needed as this is a self-limiting illness,Provide a one-off eyewash for the patient in the GP practice,General eye care including warm compress and eyelid hygiene,"Incorrect. Topical antibiotics are not first line in the treatment of blepharitis. Additionally, this is more likely to be posterior blepharitis secondary to rosacea, where topical antibiotics would not be helpful. Having said this, oral antibiotics may be prescribed for the rosacea (such as doxycycline).","Incorrect. NICE recommends that topical steroids are not prescribed for blepharitis. This may worsen bacterial blepharitis if antibiotics are not co-prescribed and the side effect profile of steroids is significant, often outweighing the benefits (including a higher risk of cataract and glaucoma).","Incorrect. Blepharitis is a chronic, long-term condition which needs constant treatment. It is not self-limiting and therefore requires management.","Incorrect. Blepharitis is a chronic, long-term condition which needs constant treatment. A one-off eyewash will not be enough.","Correct. Blepharitis is a chronic, long-term condition which needs constant treatment. General eye care including warm compress to ease any debris, and eyelid hygiene to maintain cleanliness and reduce the risk of infection are all advised as treatment and prophylaxis.",5
38,,,,54,c,,"After offering the patient advice about eyecare for her diagnosis, she asks you further about the complications of blepharitis. Which of the following is not a complication of her condition?",Corneal ulceration,Anterior uveitis,Recurrent blepharitis,Keratitis,Dry eye syndrome,"Incorrect. This is a well-recognised and important complication of blepharitis, particularly due to its recurrent nature. Corneal ulceration is important to detect via visual acuity, staining and taking a good history, and may arise secondary to long-standing dry eyes or inflammation.","Correct. Blepharitis is not a cause of anterior uveitis in any context, however the two diseases may be associated with each other where there are any underlying autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.","Incorrect. Blepharitis is well known to be a chronic and long-term disease. As a result, it is important to make the patient aware that it is likely to return after treatment.","Incorrect. This is a well-recognised and important complication of blepharitis, particularly due to its recurrent nature. Keratitis is important to detect via visual acuity and taking a good history.","Incorrect. Dry eye syndrome refers to any cause leading to excess tear evaporation or reduced amounts of tear production. In the case of blepharitis, the latter is often the issue and recurrent blepharitis can result in dry eyes over a long period of time.",2
39,active,11/01/2022,Ophthalmology,"55,56",a,"<p>A 65-year-old presents with a sudden loss of vision in his left eye since yesterday. He complains of a ‘curtain coming down’ and has noticed some flashes of light. There was no pain or a history of trauma, although he is severely myopic. </p>
On examination, the patient has a reduced visual acuity. The eye does not appear red or inflamed, but the red reflex is absent. Both pupils constrict normally when the light is shone in the right eye but dilate when shone in the left during the swinging light test.  On fundoscopy, a retinal tear can be seen with a ‘grey retina’ ballooned forward.
",What is the most likely diagnosis?,Vitreous haemorrhage,Retinal detachment,Vitreous detachment,Retinoschisis,Cataracts,"Incorrect. Vitreous haemorrhage occurs when there is bleeding into the vitreous and is often associated with underlying pathology such as diabetic retinopathy or trauma. Although sudden vision loss is a presenting feature, flashes and the description of a ‘curtain coming down’ are not typical. Additionally, his patient does not have any risk factors associated with this.","Correct. This patient has classical symptoms of a retinal detachment, including sudden vision loss, reduced visual acuity, and flashes of light. Other symptoms which may be seen include floaters.","Incorrect. This is a good differential to consider, especially since vitreous detachments are a more common cause of flashes and floaters. However, visual acuity and fields are often normal, and they are not associated with the description of a ‘curtain coming down’.","Incorrect. Retinoschisis is another good differential and occurs when the retinal layers split. Like retinal detachments, the peripheral vision is often affected however vision usually decreases over a longer period and is not associated with flashes or floaters unless vitreous/retinal detachment is also present.","Incorrect. Cataracts may explain his reduced visual acuity and loss of the red reflex, but does not explain his sudden visual loss, flashes, and floaters. Additionally, symptoms typically occur over a longer time period, and do not fit with this acute presentation.",2
39,,,,57,b,,Which of the following best describes the features seen on this patient’s examination when assessing his pupillary reflexes?,Anisocoria,Holmes-Adie pupil,Argyll Robertson pupil,Relative afferent pupillary defect,Horner’s syndrome,Incorrect. Anisocoria describes a difference of >1mm in the sizes of both pupils.,"Incorrect. Holmes-Adie pupil is typically seen in younger women and associated with damage to ciliary ganglion or postganglionic parasympathetic fibres, often secondary to infection. It presents as a unilateral, dilated pupil that does not react to light. This would be evident without doing the swinging light test. It may also be associated with absent ankle/knee reflexes (Holmes-Adie syndrome).","Incorrect. Argyll Robertson pupil is typically seen in the context of diabetes or tertiary syphilis, and presents with small, irregular pupils. These do not react to light, but quickly respond to accommodation. This occurs because the dorsal aspect of the Edinger-Westphal nuclei are typically affected (which play a role in the light reflex) whereas ventral fibres are spared (which control the accommodation reflex). Additionally, it is very rare for one eye to be affected.","Correct. RAPD can be detected using the swinging light test and may involve either the afferent (such as in this case) or efferent pathways. The affected eye fails to appropriately detect light, leading to a slower or complete lack of response. However, when light is shone in the unaffected eye it will still allow both pupils to constrict. It is more likely to be seen if there is macular involvement or if two or more quadrants are affected.","Incorrect. Horner’s syndrome involves a collection of symptoms, namely miosis (constricted pupil), anhidrosis (lack of sweating), apparent enophthalmos (sunken in eye) and ptosis. These features are not seen in this patient.",4
39,,,,58,c,,"Given this gentleman’s presentation and diagnosis, which anatomical aspects of the eye are likely to be involved?","Iris, ciliary body, and choroid",Retina and choroid,Retina and retinal pigment epithelium,Retinal pigment epithelium and choroid,Trabecular meshwork,"Incorrect. These are the components of the uvea, which is unaffected in retinal detachments, but aspects may be involved in inflammatory conditions such as posterior uveitis.","Incorrect. The retina is one of the layers involved in a detachment, but the choroid is not since the retinal pigment epithelium separates the two.","Correct. In retinal detachments, the retina separates from the retinal pigment epithelium secondary to increased fluid in the subretinal space.",Incorrect. Retinal detachments do not involve the choroid layer.,Incorrect. The trabecular meshwork may be involved in other conditions such as chronic glaucoma but does not play a role in retinal detachments.,3
39,,,,59,d,,Which of the following is the most likely type of detachment in this patient?,Rhegmatogenous,Tractional,Exudative,Combined tractional- rhegmatogenous,Infective,"Correct. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachments are characterised by the involvement of retinal tears. This patient is strongly myopic, which is an important risk factor because it causes the retina to stretch, leading to tears.",Incorrect. Tractional detachments are a type of non-rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and involve separation of the retina from the retinal pigment epithelium often due to proliferative diabetic retinopathy or contractile membranes pulling on the layer.,Incorrect. Exudative detachments are also a type of non-rhegmatogenous retinal detachment but are not associated with myopia. Causes may include inflammatory conditions such as posterior uveitis.,"Incorrect. This is most likely a pure rhegmatogenous detachment, rather than a mixed picture since there are no risk factors for this patient also developing a tractional detachment.","Incorrect. There is no history suggestive of infection, and this is not a type of retinal detachment.",1
39,,,,60,e,,Which of the following is not a risk factor for retinal detachments?,Cataract surgery,Choroidal tumour,Posterior vitreous detachment,Optic neuritis,Diabetic retinopathy,"Incorrect. This is an important risk factor of retinal detachments secondary to movement and manipulation of the vitreous humour, leading to tractional detachments.","Incorrect. Although rare, choroidal tumours can lead to exudative retinal detachments secondary to increased fluid in the subretinal space.",Incorrect. This is another cause of exudative retinal detachments because of inflammation leading to excess fluid between the retina and retinal pigment epithelium.,"Correct. Optic neuritis involves inflammation of the optic nerve, and therefore does not affect the retina severely enough to cause a detachment.","Incorrect. Diabetic retinopathy (especially proliferative) can pull on the retina, resulting in tractional detachments.",4
40,active,11/01/2022,Ophthalmology,61,a,"<p>A 72-year-old presents with a new onset of flashes of light and floaters for the past two days, with a veil coming over her vision. Her only medical history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus, for which she was diagnosed with over 30 years ago. Although she is normally seen by her optician every year, she has missed the last three appointments as she was afraid to leave her house due to COVID-19.</p>
On examination, her visual acuity reads 6/18 in the left eye and 6/36 in the right eye.  On testing of her visual fields, it appears that she has a visual defect supranasally in her right eye. Assessment of her pupillary reflexes reveals a relative afferent pupillary defect in the same eye. Fundoscopy reveals the formation of some new vessels not previously present, and a pale retina which appears opaque and wrinkled. The GP suspects the most likely diagnosis is a retinal detachment.
",What should be the next most important step that the GP should take?,Refer her for a review from ophthalmology within 24 hours,Refer her for a same day assessment to ophthalmology,Call an ambulance,Explain that she will be unable to drive,Take her blood glucose,"Incorrect. According to NICE, this is not the most appropriate next step since this lady is presenting with features of vision loss and fundoscopic signs suggest a retinal detachment. If she did not have any of these features, it would be appropriate to refer within 24 hours.","Correct. This lady has presented with visual and fundoscopic signs suggestive of sight-threatening disease. As a result, NICE recommended that she should be referred to the hospital for a same day assessment.","Incorrect. Although she has signs of sight-threatening disease, it would be inappropriate to call an ambulance since this patient is not suffering a life-threatening disease, and the services could be used better elsewhere.","Incorrect. Although this may be the case, her ability to drive will be decided based on her report to the DVLA, and not something that the GP can decide on. Also, the most pressing matter at hand is to refer her as soon as possible.","Incorrect. This is an important step in her care pathway and may indeed be done by the GP at some stage, but it is most important to refer her to secondary care first.",2
40,,,,62,b,,"Given the findings on examination, where is the most likely site of this lady’s retinal detachment?",Supranasal arcade with involvement of the macula,Infranasal arcade with no involvement of the macula,Supranasal arcade with no involvement of the macula,Infratemporal arcade with involvement of the macula,Infratemporal arcade with no involvement of the macula,"Incorrect. The anatomy of the eyes and perception of light is such that the location of the detachment is upside-down and left-right of the area not visible to the patient. However, macula involvement is highly likely given her visual acuity has decreased significantly and she has a RAPD.","Incorrect. The anatomy of the eyes and perception of light is such that the location of the detachment is upside-down and left-right of an area not visible to the patient. Additionally, macula involvement is highly likely given her visual acuity has decreased significantly and she has a RAPD.","Incorrect. The anatomy of the eyes and perception of light is such that the location of the detachment is upside-down and left-right of an area not visible to the patient. Additionally, macula involvement is highly likely given her visual acuity has decreased significantly and she has a RAPD.",Correct. This is the only answer that describes the correct location of the detachment and involves the macula.,"Incorrect. Although the location is correct, macula involvement is highly likely given her visual acuity has decreased significantly and she has a RAPD.",4
40,,,,63,c,"The GP refers this lady to the ophthalmologist the same day, but whilst she is travelling there, she trips and falls over and sustains a head injury. A bystander calls an ambulance, and she is sent to the hospital where a full work up is commenced. The on-call ophthalmologist attends to see her and conducts a fundoscopy, but notices that there is blood in the right eye and is unable to clearly view the retina.","In relation to the continued assessment of her retinal detachment, which of the following investigations would be most appropriate to investigate this further?",CT head scan,Full blood count,Goldman’s tonometry,Humphrey perimetry test,B-scan ultrasonography,"Incorrect. Although a CT would be very important to conduct in this case, it would not be helpful to further assess the state of the retina.","Incorrect. This will most likely be done as part of the full workup, but again will not yield any further details about the retinal detachment.","Incorrect. Goldman’s tonometry is a useful tool to assess the intraocular pressure which may be useful to look for signs of glaucoma, but this lady does not have any presenting features.","Incorrect. Perimetry testing may be done to assess for where the visual field defect is, however, it is unlikely to yield any accurate results since she currently has blood in her eye. Additionally, this test takes a long time and is inappropriate to conduct on someone who has just had a head injury.",Correct. B-scan ultrasonography is a useful tool which can be used to assess the retinal layer when the view is obstructed with blood. This can also be conducted safely on someone who has had head trauma.,5

He explains that to prevent this happening in the future, she should attend her optician appointments and diabetes reviews regularly.",Which of the following additional measures is most used as a prophylactic therapy to prevent retinal detachments in the future?,Retinotomy,Scleral buckle,Laser retinopexy,Laser iridotomy,Retinal transplant,Incorrect. This is useful in the treatment of a retinal detachment to remove extra fluid behind the retina but is not used as a prophylactic therapy.,"Incorrect. This is a good management option to keep the retina in place during definitive management, although it is rarely used as a prophylactic measure.","Correct. Laser retinopexy is a useful mode of treatment which can be used to repair retinal tears before they lead to detachments, which can reduce the risk of future detachments by 80-90%. Cryopexy may also be used.",Incorrect. Laser iridotomy is a procedure conducted in acute closed angle glaucoma to allow aqueous humour to drain from the anterior chamber of the eye and does not play a role in preventing retinal detachments.,Incorrect. This is not a therapy that is currently available.,3
40,,,,65,e,,Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention to reduce traction on the retina during definitive management?,Vitrectomy,Retinopexy,Silicon oil insert,Retinotomy,Cryopexy,Correct. Vitrectomy and scleral buckle are the two main interventions that help to reduce traction on the retina.,"Incorrect. Retinopexy is used to adhere back the retina in place, but does not reduce traction.",Incorrect. Silicon oil insert is helpful for keeping the retina in place but does not reduce traction per se.,Incorrect. Retinotomy is used to drain the fluid in the subretinal space to allow for easier adhering.,Incorrect. Cryopexy is also used to adhere the retina back in place.,1

She is admitted to hospital where the doctor assesses and examines the patient. They identify that there appears to be a swollen eyelid associated with a red eye and hypopyon.",What is the most likely diagnosis?,Astigmatism,Retained lens material,Endophthalmitis,Acute angle glaucoma,Anterior uveitis,Incorrect. Astigmatism may occur because of surgery but presents as reduced or blurred vision which is painless and does not present so acutely.,"Incorrect. Retained lens material may be a complication of cataracts surgery, where some of the original lens is not fully removed, leading to an autoimmune reaction and inflammation in the area. This patient did not have her lens changed.","Correct. The most likely diagnosis in this case in endophthalmitis, which involves overwhelming inflammation in the eye secondary to bacterial infection. It is very important to diagnose this quickly, and is treated using systemic antibiotics, or intravitreal if there is no response to initial therapies. Topical cycloplegics such as atropine can be used to dilate the pupils and reduce pain.","Incorrect. Although many of the symptoms of acute glaucoma are like endophthalmitis, the key here is the presence of a hypopyon and eyelid swelling are not typically a feature of glaucoma.

This describes a diagnosis of anterior uveitis which is associated with autoimmune diseases and does not typically present with purulent discharge.,"Correct. The most likely diagnosis is infective conjunctivitis due to the spreading nature of the disease from the children to the teacher. It also fits with her symptoms including purulent discharge, and the red dotted lesions in the inner eyelid describe papillae (which are not seen in viral conjunctivitis).","Incorrect.

Patients often have a history of atopy too, which is not mentioned here. Although chemosis (conjunctival swelling) is a common feature in allergic conjunctivitis, the overall picture points to another diagnosis.","Correct. Neisserial conjunctivitis presents very acutely (within 12-24 hours) and patients often present with eye pain, eyelid swelling and copious amounts of purulent discharge from their eye. Corneal ulcers are common complications and account for the photophobia in this patient (conjunctivitis does not typically cause photophobia unless the cornea is involved). Preauricular lymphadenopathy is another classical feature of this too. The history of dysuria and purulent discharge from the penis should raise questions about a potential STI, which explains how he would have come into contact with the bacteria.","Although the STI symptoms could point you to this diagnosis, it is less likely than neisserial conjunctivitis. Inclusion conjunctivitis (most common type of chlamydial conjunctivitis in developed countries) can also cause preauricular lymphadenopathy, however you would expect papillary hyperplasia of the tarsal conjunctiva which is not mentioned in the stem. Furthermore, chlamydial conjunctivitis does not typically present as acutely as this.","Acute angle-closure glaucoma is an ocular emergency which must be ruled out in any patient presenting with acute eye pain and red eye. However, this is a less likely diagnosis simply based on the fact that you would not expect purulent discharge and preauricular lymphadenopathy. Although visual acuity is reduced in acute glaucoma, you would expect the pupil in the affected eye to be fixed, dilated and unresponsive to light; none of which are the case here.","Anterior uveitis is a very reasonable differential in this case. It accounts for the pain, reduced visual acuity and photophobia. However you would not expect such severe eyelid inflammation, purulent discharge or even chemosis.

Furthermore, patients may have a history of atopy (i.e. allergic dermatitis) which is not present here. The recent URTI points you in the direction of viral conjunctivitis.","Viral conjunctivitis usually presents with bilateral (but can be unilateral) watery eyes and a history of a recent URTI. Conjunctival follicles are features of viral conjunctivitis too. Most cases of conjunctivitis present similarly (pain, grittiness, discharge) so it is important to know how to distinguish between the 3 main types.","Endophthalmitis is a rare, sight-threatening condition involving inflammation of the vitreous humour.

Viral meningitis is diagnosed with CSF PCR for enteroviruses, HSV-1&2 and varicella zoster. A throat swab may also be used for enteroviruses.","Incorrect. This is not helpful in identifying viruses that cause meningitis as they are not usually found in the blood. However, a blood PCR can be done to identify meningococcus.",Incorrect. The CT head would not be capable of identifying a causative virus.,Incorrect. Urine PCR would not be capable of identifying a causative virus.,Incorrect.

A FBC is done in this case. Due to the suspected sepsis and/or meningitis there is a need to look at the changes of white cell count (to see infection) and platelets (for thrombocytopenia in case of DIC in severe disease).,"Incorrect. A clotting screen is done in this case. This is to check for DIC which can occur in meningococcal disease most commonly. This would show a prolonged PT, aPTT, bleeding time and a low fibrinogen.","Incorrect. A chest X-ray will be done in this patient. This patient presented with a productive cough with green sputum and specks of blood, thus giving grounds to suspect pneumonia. A chest X-ray will be needed to diagnose pneumonia.","Correct.

However, they can be done after administering empirical IV antibiotics and are not of the highest immediate priority.","Incorrect. CXR is important in the diagnosis of pneumonia but this patient is in need of urgent IV antibiotics due to the signs of sepsis and meningism, thus IV antibiotics will take a more immediate priority.","Incorrect. Clotting studies are important in checking for DIC however this patient does not have a petechial rash and with the combination of sepsis and signs of meningism, IV antibiotics take a more immediate priority.","Incorrect. IV paracetamol can be given as an adjunct to the antibiotics to control the pyrexia, however they do not solve the sepsis and thus this patient will need IV antibiotics more immediately than IV paracetamol.",1

Kernig’s sign can present in this patient. This is characterised by pain in the lower back or back of the thigh on extension of the knee when the hip is flexed to a 90° right angle. It is a sign of meningeal irritation however, it is not specific to bacterial meningitis.",Incorrect. Papilloedema can be present in this patient. This is a sign of raised ICP and meningitis can lead to a raised ICP due to cerebral oedema from inflammation.,"Correct. You would not expect to see an INO in a patient presenting with the clinical picture above. INO can be seen in multiple sclerosis, where there is a demyelinating lesion to the medial longitudinal fasciculus, resulting in an inability of both eyes to perform lateral gaze in a coordinated manner.","Incorrect. Bruzinski’s sign can be present in this patient. Seen when passive flexion of the neck elicits flexion of the knees and/or hips, or passive flexion of one leg causes flexion of the opposite leg. It is a sign of meningeal irritation however, it is not specific to bacterial meningitis.",Incorrect.

There is no indication for intrathecal antibiotics at this stage of her management. Furthermore given that empirical antibiotics are already being provided, it would be unnecessary to provide intrathecal antibiotics as well.",Correct. IV dexamethasone is given adjunct to antibiotics in order to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process in the subarachnoid space. This has been found to reduce morbidity and mortality.,Incorrect. IV hydrocortisone is not beneficial in the management of meningitis and it would not be given alongside empirical antibiotics.,Incorrect. Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent and is used as chemotherapy against various cancers. It has no role to play in meningitis and would not be used in its treatment.,Incorrect.

At the GP she demonstrated a positive ice pack test.,Which of the following would most strongly suggest the diagnosis of MG?,Proximal limb weakness which improves with repetitive movement,Maintain upgaze for > 1 minute,A positive Hoffman’s sign,Dysarthria associated with tongue fasciculations and hypertonia,Difficulty chewing at the end of a meal,"This is the classical finding for Lambert-Eaton syndrome, a paraneoplastic syndrome often associated with small cell lung carcinoma. We would expect MG to demonstrate fatigability and worsen with prolonged use.","This is referring to the Simpson’s test. The patient is asked to look up at a superiorly placed finger for >1 minute. Typically in MG, due to fatigability, the patient will develop ptosis or need to move their head upwards to maintain focus. This demonstrates a positive Simpson’s test",Hoffman's test refers to involuntary flexion of the thumb and index finger when the nail of the middle finger is flicked down. This demonstrates pathology of the corticospinal tract and as such is often positive in upper motor neuron lesions such as stroke or spinal cord injury. MG is a disease of the neuromuscular junction and as such we would expect this to be negative.,"The presence of hypertonia and tongue fasciculations suggests mixed upper and lower motor neuron symptoms, which may be classically seen in motor neurone disease. MG is a disease of the neuromuscular junction and as such we would expect no fasciculations and normal tone.","Correct. MG is a disease of the neuromuscular junction which demonstrates fatigability. Alongside the ocular muscles, MG can progress to involve the bulbar muscles which aid in speech, swallowing and chewing. The key feature here is that it demonstrates fatigability i.e. the weakness is worsened with prolonged use.",5

Given the extensive history of smoking this is a good differential. However, the history of weakness demonstrates fatigability, as shown by the worsening of the weakness at the end of the day. This is far more characteristic of MG than LES (where repetitive actions often lead to an improvement in the weakness).",Correct. The history here hints towards fatigability as the diplopia and difficulty chewing most commonly occurs after prolonged use. This is far more suggestive of MG.,"MS often also presents with ocular symptoms, however optic neuritis and loss of red saturation often tends to be the more common feature. Furthermore, MS is a demyelinating condition and as such, during a flare, we would not expect the weakness to show diurnal variation or fatigability (i.e. the diplopia or chewing should not worsen further with prolonged use).","Transient ischaemic attacks refers to a transient cerebral ischemia occurring due to transient occlusion of blood vessels in the brain. Smoking, atrial fibrillation and carotid artery stenosis are all big risk factors. However, we would not expect the weakness to typically worsen following prolonged use in the cases of a TIA. This is far more suggestive of fatigability as seen in MG.","Horner’s syndrome is the combination of partial ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis and enophthalmos which occurs due to damage or disruption to the sympathetic supply to the eye. This leads to a parasympathetic overdrive leading to the symptoms described. Bilateral horner’s syndrome is extremely rare and it is typically unilateral.

MG is a disorder of the neuromuscular junction. This means all other pathways (sensory, autonomic as well as reflex pathways) should be intact. As such MG classically has a normal neurological examination with isolated weakness. The weakness worsens with repetitive use.",These are findings you would expect in the case of a lower motor neuron lesion such as a radiculopathy or Guillain-Barre syndrome.,This is more suggestive of dorsal column involvement as is the case with B12 deficiency.,This suggests damage to the spinothalamic tract.

With the patient resting their flexed knee on a surface, the calf muscles are squeezed to see if plantarflexion of the ankle joint occurs. It is primarily an orthopaedic test and is not used in MG.",Correct. In patients with ptosis and suspected MG the ice pack can be applied to the eyebrows for five minutes. The cold temperature inhibits the action of acetylcholinesterase and as such increases the available ACh at the neuromuscular junction. This leads to temporary relief and improvement in the symptoms and can be used to provide evidence for MG,"The edrophonium test refers to a challenge with IV short acting acetylcholinesterase inhibitors to clinically detect a relief in symptoms. It is a historical test used before antibody testing or EMG was available. Nowadays it is rarely used but may be indicated if there is diagnostic doubt (i.e. patient is negative for all the known antibodies). The application of high doses of IV acetylcholinesterase inhibitors can lead to parasympathetic overdrive, leading to life-threatening bradycardia. As such this is inappropriate to perform at the GP, as often resuscitation facilities are needed.",Tinel’s test involves tapping over the flexor retinaculum of the wrist to recreate symptoms of median nerve compression in carpal tunnel syndrome. It is not used in MG.,"The ice pack test, rather than the warm compress test is used in MG to clinically provide evidence.

Although Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is associated with MG, these antibodies do not cause MG.",Correct. 80-90% of cases of MG will have anti ACh receptor antibodies. It is thought that these antibodies activate complement proteins leading to the destruction of binding sites of ACh on the postsynaptic membrane of the NMJ. This rationale has been used to apply eculizumab as a potential management option for MG. This is a complement inhibitor and has been shown to improve patients symptoms in MG.,These antibodies are detected in Lambert-Eaton syndrome rather than MG.,These antibodies are detected in anti-phospholipid syndrome,These antibodies are detected in coeliac disease,2

The first line options for the treatment of MG include symptomatic relief with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. This stops the breakdown of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, increasing availability and chance of binding. Other first line options include immunosuppression with corticosteroids, and thymectomy.",Oxybutynin is an antimuscarinic agent which competitively inhibits the action of acetylcholine. It is contraindicated in MG as it can make the weakness worse or precipitate a myasthenic crisis.,"Although immunosuppression is a first line option for the management of MG, corticosteroids or azathioprine is used first line. Methotrexate may be used in cases of MG unresponsive to initial azathioprine or corticosteroid treatment","Rituximab may be used in severe MG and is not used as the first line agent.

Up to 70% of cases may also have thymic hyperplasia.,"MG is a disorder of the neuromuscular junction. There is no suspected pathology of the spinal cord or CSF and as such a lumbar puncture is not routinely used. It may be used in cases of suspected meningitis, multiple sclerosis or Guillain-Barre syndrome.","Muscle biopsies are not commonly done in MG.

In cases of massive PE (saddle embolus), alteplase is the preferred agent for thrombolysis.

This leads to abnormal platelet activation and clot formation, leading to DVTs and PEs in the venous system and increasing the risk for stroke and MI in the arterial system. This condition is also associated with poor placental development and function, leading to recurrent miscarriages, pre-eclampsia, premature birth, and stillbirths.","Do not be fooled by the ‘thrombocytopenia’. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia conversely increases the risk of clots and digital infarcts. Heparin may bind to platelet factor 4. This leads to the development of antibodies against the platelet factor 4/heparin complexes. Once these antibodies bind, they cause inappropriate platelet activation, leading to clot formation.

Clinical examination of the peripheral nervous system is normal.","Given the presentation above, which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Ischaemic stroke,Bell’s palsy,Haemorrhagic stroke,Multiple sclerosis,Primary brain tumour,"Incorrect. A stroke would present with facial paralysis with forehead sparing as the contralateral hemisphere will send motor fibres to supply the forehead. In Bell's palsy the lesion occurs after all the motor fibres supplying the forehead join up, thus there is NO forehead sparing. Stroke diagnosis needs a CT scan.","Correct. Bell’s palsy will present with acute unilateral facial palsy without forehead sparing. It also presents with other motor, sensory and parasympathetic symptoms due to the lesion being lower down thus affecting a range of fibres which have all joined together. These symptoms include hyperacusis, ear pain, post-auricular region pain, change in taste, dry eyes and dry mouth. Bell’s palsy is caused by damage to the facial nerve (CN7) at the meatal section, causing demyelination at the site and compression against a narrow canal due to oedema.","Incorrect. A stroke would present with facial paralysis with forehead sparing as the contralateral hemisphere will send motor fibres to supply the forehead. In Bell's palsy the lesion occurs after all the motor fibres supplying the forehead join up, thus there is NO forehead sparing. Haemorrhagic stroke will only be diagnosed on CT scan.","Incorrect. Multiple sclerosis presents with intermittent symptoms and can cause a large range of neurological deficits (motor, sensory, autonomic). It typically presents with vision changes secondary to optic neuritis. Bell’s palsy manifestations are local to CN7.","Incorrect. Brain tumours are an important differential to CN7 palsies but they would usually have other associated symptoms e.g. insidious onset, unusual distribution of facial weakness, headache, nausea, fever etc. Bell’s palsy will only present with symptoms of CN7 damage.",2

Diabetes is a risk factor for Bell’s palsy but it is not the most important risk factor.,Correct. Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 is the most important risk factor for bell’s palsy and is thought to be the direct cause in some cases. This is especially so if HSV-1 is present in a patient with concomitant immunosuppression.,"Incorrect. This is the cause of Ramsay Hunt Syndrome which occurs due to the shingles virus (herpes zoster) being reactivated at the geniculate ganglion, affecting the facial nerve. It presents with a painful vesicular rash at the external ear canal and pinna, facial paralysis. The vestibulocochlear nerve (CNVIII) lies within close proximity to the facial nerve and can also be affected, possibly leading to hearing loss and vertigo. It is a differential to Bell’s palsy and thus herpes zoster is not a risk factor.","Incorrect. Rheumatoid arthritis can cause mononeuritis multiplex which is a painful, asymmetrical, asynchronous sensory and motor peripheral neuropathy involving isolated damage to at least 2 separate nerve areas.

This is a red flag sign and suggests a tumour in the brain. Uneven facial weakness can occur due to the tumour locally compressing on the facial nuclei or due to mass effect pushing motor fibres to the face.,Incorrect. This is a red flag symptom and suggests a tumour in the brain compressing on other cranial nerves.,Incorrect. These are red flags in the context of a facial nerve palsy as it is suggestive of cancer and requires urgent referral to secondary care.,"Correct. This is to be expected of Bell's palsy, there is nothing atypical or urgently worrying about the typical presentation of Bell’s palsy.","Incorrect. Hearing loss is suggestive of a cerebello-pontine angle (CPA) tumour, since the nerve roots of the facial nerve and vestibulocochlear nerve travel together at the CPA, a CPA tumour compressing on both cranial nerves can cause hearing loss as well as a facial nerve palsy.",4

Lubricating eye drops are often recommended where there is an inability to close the eyes. This is to prevent keratoconjunctivitis sicca.,"Incorrect. Swimming is best avoided, especially where there is an inability to close the eyes. This prevents exposure to bacteria and viruses that may be in the pool.","Incorrect. Dusty places are best avoided as patients with CN7 palsy cannot lacrimate or close their eyes, thus their ability to clear dust out of their eyes is impaired. Dust can promote drying and ulceration.","Incorrect.

Sympathomimetic drugs work by upregulating the sympathetic nervous system (such as activating alpha 1 receptors) which leads to contraction of the iris dilator muscle and pupil dilation. They can safely be used in patients with myasthenia gravis (unlike antimuscarinics - which can also be used for pupillary dilation).,Incorrect. Sympathetic systems are activated not inhibited with this drug.,Incorrect. The parasympathetic system is not involved.,Incorrect The parasympathetic system is not involved.,Incorrect. Only the sympathetic nervous system is involved.,1
65,,,,238,b,,Sympathomimetics are not contraindicated in which of the following conditions?,Hypertension,History of previous myocardial infarction,Diabetes,Depression,Thyrotoxicosis,"Incorrect. Hypertension may worsen following application of these drugs. Sympathomimetics mimic or amplify the action of endogenous catecholamines such as adrenaline and noradrenaline, which raise blood pressure and heart rate as part of the fight-or-flight response.","Incorrect. Sympathomimetics mimic or amplify the action of endogenous catecholamines such as adrenaline and noradrenaline, which raise blood pressure and heart rate as part of the fight-or-flight response. There may be a higher risk of further MIs due to higher blood pressure.",Incorrect. Activating sympathetic pathways leads to an increase in blood glucose by inhibiting insulin secretion from the beta-cells of pancreas and stimulating glucagon secretion from the alpha cells in the pancreas. This can have detrimental effects to patients who are already diabetic.,Correct. There are no contraindications to people with depression.,"Incorrect. Sympathomimetics mimic or amplify the action of endogenous catecholamines such as adrenaline and noradrenaline, which raise blood pressure and heart rate as part of the fight-or-flight response. Patients with thyrotoxicosis are at risk of a hypertensive response because thyroid hormones increase the contractility of the heart as well as cardiac output, both of which raise the blood pressure.",4
65,,,,239,c,,Which of the following drugs may be safely prescribed with sympathomimetic drugs?,Selegiline,Dantrolene,Amitriptyline,Digoxin,Quinidine,Incorrect. Selegiline is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor which may lead to excessive hypertension if used together.,Correct. There are no known interactions between these two drugs.,Incorrect. Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant and may potentiate the effect of sympathomimetics.,Incorrect. Giving digoxin alongside sympathomimetics increases the risk of arrhythmias.,Incorrect. Giving quinidine alongside sympathomimetics increases the risk of arrhythmias.,2

She explains that it came on when she was watching TV in a poorly lit room. </p> The doctor suspects that she may have developed acute angle closure glaucoma.",Which of the following topical drugs from the list below is most appropriate to prescribe in this scenario?,Atropine,Tropicamide,Pilocarpine,Phenylephrine,Cyclopentolate,Incorrect. Atropine is an antimuscarinic drug which would further dilate the pupil and close the drainage angle even more. This is contraindicated in acute glaucoma.,Incorrect. Tropicamide is an antimuscarinic drug which would further dilate the pupil and close the drainage angle even more. This is contraindicated in acute glaucoma.,"Correct. Pilocarpine is an example of a cholinergic medication, which works by acting on the parasympathetic system and causing pupil constriction. This opens the drainage angle, reducing intraocular pressure in the affected eye.",Incorrect. Phenylephrine is a sympathomimetic drug which would further dilate the pupil and close the drainage angle even more. This is contraindicated in acute glaucoma.,Incorrect. Cyclopentolate is an antimuscarinic drug which would further dilate the pupil and close the drainage angle even more. This is contraindicated in acute glaucoma.,3
66,,,,242,b,,Which of the following conditions is pilocarpine most safe to prescribe in?,Anterior uveitis,Asthma,Previous history of lymphoma,Cardiac disease,Parkinson’s disease,Incorrect. Constricting the pupil is highly undesirable in anterior uveitis because the pupillary sphincter muscle is already inflamed and it may worsen pain. Anterior uveitis increases your risk of developing posterior (as well as anterior) synechiae - adhesions which form between the posterior surface of the iris and the anterior surface of the lens. Pilocarpine use increases this risk even more.,Incorrect. Cholinergic medications may exacerbate asthma as they can cause bronchospasm.,Correct. There are no known issues with using these drugs in someone who has a previous history of lymphoma.,Incorrect. This drug may increase the risk of another episode of cardiac associated disease.,Incorrect. Cholinergic drugs may worsen the symptoms associated with Parkinson’s disease. Parkinson’s disease symptoms are caused by a lack of dopamine in the body. This leads to an imbalance between dopamine and acetylcholine which can exacerbate symptoms (excess acetylcholine has been shown to increase the risk of dyskinesia). Cholinergic drugs would potentiate the effect of acetylcholine and worsen symptoms.,3
66,,,,243,c,,Which of the following is not a side effect associated with cholinergic drugs?,Excessive saliva production,Watery eyes,Diarrhoea,Excessive sweating,Tachycardia,Incorrect. This is a known side effect of cholinergic medications since they activate the parasympathetic system which is responsible for saliva production.,Incorrect. This is a known side effect of cholinergic medications since they activate the parasympathetic system which is responsible for lacrimation.,Incorrect. This is a known side effect of cholinergic medications since they activate the parasympathetic system which mediates peristalsis.,Incorrect. This is a known side effect of cholinergic medications since they activate the parasympathetic system which plays an important role in initiating micturition as acetylcholine stimulates contraction of the detrusor muscle.,"Correct. Since the parasympathetic system is activated, it is bradycardia which may be a side effect, rather than tachycardia.",5

His visual acuity is found to be slightly worse than last time, from 6/9 to 6/12 in both eyes. The patient’s visual field is normal bilaterally and light reflexes are normal, however there is a bilateral increase in his intraocular pressure. Ophthalmoscopy reveals optic disc cupping in both eyes.
",Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Macular degeneration,Open angle glaucoma,Closed angle glaucoma,Raised intracranial pressure,Anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy,Incorrect. Macular degeneration is an age-related disorder that presents with worsening central vision due to involvement of the macula. Fundoscopic features may include drusen (dry AMD) and neovascularization (wet AMD) depending on the type of disease.,Correct. Open angle glaucoma is typically diagnosed incidentally and is diagnosed through identifying optic nerve injury on fundoscopy. Pressures may be normal or raised.,"Incorrect. Closed angle (acute) glaucoma presents as a red and painful eye which is semi-dilated and has a hazy cornea. These features are not seen in this history, and acute glaucoma often presents unilaterally.","Incorrect. Though raised intraocular pressure may cause optic disc swelling (papilledema), other features would be expected in the history such as morning headaches worse when lying down, cranial nerve palsies or nausea/vomiting.","Incorrect. Anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy presents unilaterally with amaurosis fugax (transient loss of vision). Fundoscopy in the affected eye would show pallor and swelling of the optic disc. It is also associated with giant cell arteritis. There are no features of GCA in the stem either (scalp tenderness, pain on chewing).",2

67,,,,"248,249",c,,Which of the following is not a risk factor for open angle glaucoma?,Increasing age,Raised intraocular pressure,Hyperopia,Myopia,Cardiovascular disease,"Incorrect. Increasing age is a risk factor for glaucoma as age related debris may block the trabecular meshwork, increasing the risk of glaucoma by reducing aqueous outflow.",Incorrect. Any patient with increased intraocular pressure is more likely to develop glaucoma due to increased stress and risk of ischaemia to the optic nerve.,"Correct. Hyperopia (far-sightedness) is a key risk factor for acute closed angle glaucoma, not open angle. This is because patients with hyperopia typically have short eyeballs which causes their iridocorneal angle to be more acute, therefore increasing the risk of closure.","Incorrect. Myopia may be a risk factor for open angle glaucoma due to a higher risk of pigment dispersion syndrome, whereby pigments from the iris deposits on the trabecular meshwork and leads to gradual blockage.",Incorrect. Cardiovascular disease may cause ischaemia and lead to glaucoma secondary to optic nerve damage.,3

The doctor explains that her father may have developed open angle glaucoma and, being a keen medical student, she would like to know more about the cells involved.",Which of the following cells are injured in glaucoma?,Bipolar neurons,Astrocyte,Retinal ganglion cells,Retinal pigment epithelium cells,Photoreceptors,Incorrect. Bipolar neurons are found in the retina and are important for transmitting signals to perceive vision. They are not found in the optic nerve.,Incorrect. Astrocytes are star shaped glial cells in the brain which form part of the blood brain barrier. They are not affected by glaucomatous optic nerve injury.,Correct. Retinal ganglion cells are located in the optic nerve and become damaged secondary to increased stress or ischaemia related to glaucoma. This results in loss of vision overtime.,Incorrect. Retinal pigment epithelium cells are located above the subretinal space. These cells are not typically involved in glaucoma but may be associated with other pathologies such as retinal detachments.,Incorrect. Photoreceptors are found within the retina and found just above the retinal pigment epithelial layer. They are not associated with optic nerve damage.,3
67,,,,"251,252",e,,Which of the following mechanisms does not explain a pathophysiological process of open angle glaucoma?,Proliferation of new vessels on the optic nerve,Ischaemia,Metabolic stress,Axonal compression,Over-sensitive optic nerve,"Correct. Glaucoma does not involve proliferation of new vessels, but this may be seen in other conditions such as diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity.",Incorrect. High pressure or hypercoagulable states may lead to optic nerve damage secondary to retinal ganglion cell ischaemia.,Incorrect. High pressures can lead to build up of free radicals leading to metabolic stress and cell injury.,Incorrect. High pressures may result in axonal compression which prevents transport of trophic factors needed for cell development.,Incorrect. Some patients may develop glaucoma with no rise in intraocular pressure. The reason behind this is unclear but is thought to be due to an over-sensitive optic nerve which may become damaged at normal pressures. Treatment is the same as high pressure glaucoma.,1

The history indicates anaemia and leukopenia, and abdominal examination revealed splenomegaly. These should raise suspicion for a haematological malignancy. ALL is the most common cancer in childhood, and comprises 80% of all childhood leukaemias.","Incorrect. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is characterised by ineffective lymphocyte apoptosis leading to fragile lymphocytes which cannot mount a proper immune response. Patients can often be asymptomatic or may present with recurrent infection. CLL is more common in the elderly so would be very unlikely in the patient. Also, the features of anaemia and leukopenia, with splenomegaly identified on examination, makes ALL the most likely diagnosis.","Incorrect. AML presents more commonly in adults than children. Children with Down’s syndrome are more at risk of developing AML but this is absent in this patient. Although features of anaemia and leukopenia, and splenomegaly could be presenting features of AML, ALL is the more likely diagnosis due to its peak incidence in childhood.","Incorrect. CML occurs mainly in adults due to the t(9;22) translocation, also known as the Philadelphia translocation. This diagnosis is unlikely in children. ALL is the most common childhood cancer so her history of anaemia, leukopenia and splenomegaly makes this the most likely diagnosis.","<p>Incorrect. Multiple myeloma is more common in adults.

The most likely diagnosis here is ALL. As such, a white cell count is very often abnormal, being raised due to the increased lymphoblast count. Neutropenia is a very common feature due to infiltration of the bone marrow and lymphopenia. Very rarely, a WCC may be normal if bone marrow suppression has not yet occurred, however, this is unlikely in this patient who has presented with features of anaemia and leukopenia.",Incorrect. Serum LDH tends to be significantly elevated in ALL due to the increased cell turnover.,Incorrect. A blood film is often used to visualise leukemic blasts in ALL.,"Correct. Although DIC can be a feature, it is unlikely here as we have no history of oozing blood or unusual bleeding. As such, PT and APTT are likely normal for this patient.","Incorrect.

Visualisation of blasts on peripheral blood smear would support the diagnosis of ALL. However, the lineage of these blasts needs to be determined to rule out AML.","Incorrect. A raised LDH supports the diagnosis of ALL. However, it is not diagnostic for ALL as other diseases that cause increased cell turnover will also demonstrate raised LDH.",Incorrect. LFTs and U&Es are mainly baseline investigations performed to check for risk of nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity associated with chemotherapy. They would not aid the diagnosis of ALL.,Correct. The World Health Organisation requires >20% of bone marrow to be composed of lymphoid progenitor cells for a diagnosis for ALL.

This is a classic scenario of tumour lysis syndrome, a syndrome that occurs due to rapid cell breakdown and spillage of intracellular components into the blood. Sodium is mainly an extracellular ion and exists in the greatest concentration in the blood, thus the spillage of intracellular components does not typically affect the sodium values.","Incorrect. This is a classic scenario of tumour lysis syndrome, a syndrome that occurs due to rapid cell breakdown and spillage of intracellular components into the blood. High intracellular concentrations of phosphate and potassium are released into the circulation, leading to the classical findings of hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia. The excess phosphate in the circulation reacts with calcium to precipitate out, forming calcium phosphate and reducing circulating calcium levels. The increased cell turnover also increases serum uric acid.","Correct. This is a classic scenario of tumour lysis syndrome, a syndrome that occurs due to rapid cell breakdown and spillage of intracellular components into the blood. High intracellular concentrations of phosphate and potassium are released into the circulation leading to the characteristic hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia. The excessive phosphate in circulation reacts with calcium to precipitate out forming calcium phosphate and reducing circulating calcium levels. This leads to hypocalcaemia. The increased cell turnover also increases serum uric acid.","Incorrect.

Retinitis pigmentosa may present in this patient’s age range with worsening peripheral vision, but night-time vision is often also affected due to a loss of rod cells, and fundoscopy shows a ‘salt and pepper’ retina.","Correct. Open angle glaucoma is often diagnosed incidentally but may present with worsening peripheral vision. Fundoscopy shows optic disc cupping, pallor, and vessel bayoneting - where vessels appear to enter and leave the optic disc in different places.","Incorrect. Though cataract is a good differential in a patient with a gradual loss of their vision, it often presents with worsening colour vision, halos around lights and poor night-time vision. Clouding of the retina may be seen, as well as a loss of red reflex in the affected eye. The fundoscopy changes seen here are not typical.","Incorrect.

Tonometry is the investigation that is conducted to measure the pressures. It involves using a fluorescein dye, slit lamp and tonometer to measure the readings (Goldman’s tonometry, but there are other ways of measuring pressure such as using a puff of air).","Correct. Tonometry is a useful measure to assess pressures, but results can be underestimated if the patient has a thin cornea and overestimated if they have a thick cornea. This may be a problem since it may incorrectly diagnose raised intraocular pressure. Pachymetry is a method of measuring corneal thickness.",Incorrect. Gonioscopy can be used to assess the drainage angle and is a useful test in the diagnosis of acute angle glaucoma but would not be helpful in ensuring intraocular pressure readings are accurate.,"Incorrect. Perimetry can be a useful investigation to quantify visual loss in glaucoma. It is conducted by asking the patient to press a buzzer when they see a flash of light. Where they do not, the area will be highlighted as visual loss. This can produce a map of the patient’s vision, and what they can/cannot see.","Incorrect. OCT is an investigation used in many retinal pathologies and is a useful measure of providing a cross section of the eye.

Scintillating scotomas may be seen in conditions such as migraines and are described as flashes of light or zigzagging. They are not associated with glaucoma.,"Incorrect. Central scotomas are described as a loss of vision centrally. Glaucoma affects peripheral vision initially, although central vision may be affected by conditions such as macular degeneration.",Correct. Arcuate scotomas are a type of vision loss that occur in a curved fashion between 10 and 20 degrees. They are associated with glaucoma.,Incorrect. Homonymous hemianopia refers to vision loss of one side in both eyes (right or left) and is most caused by optic tract lesions or causes of neurological deficit such as stroke (i.e. posterior circulation strokes which affect the visual cortex).,Incorrect. Altitudinal field defects are described as either upper or lower visual defects that do not cross the midline.

However, the history of a bone marrow transplant prior to the onset of symptoms as well as the diarrhoea and jaundice make GVHD the most likely diagnosis.</p>","Incorrect. This is an acute complication of excessive cell destruction, leading to spillage of intracellular components. The characteristic findings are hyperkalaemia, hyperphosphataemia, hyperuricaemia, and hypocalcaemia. It usually presents with muscle pain following intense chemotherapy. Here, the history of a bone marrow transplant prior to the onset of symptoms as well as the diarrhoea and jaundice make GVHD the most likely diagnosis.","Correct. This is an immune-mediated response in an immunocompromised patient. Usually, in immunocompetent patients, the donor’s T cells are destroyed by the host’s T cells. However, immunocompromised patients are unable to do this. As a result, the donor helper T cells recognise the host’s tissue as foreign and launch an immune response against them. Most commonly, this process affects the skin (leading to itchy rashes and skin desquamation), the GI tract (leading to watery diarrhoea and vomiting), and liver (leading to jaundice).","Incorrect. This classically presents with target shaped annular lesions following exposure to drugs or viruses (especially the herpes simplex virus). Desquamation of the skin is not a feature of this.

No neovascularization or geographic atrophy is seen in either eye.",Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Early stage dry age-related macular degeneration,Late-stage dry age-related macular degeneration,Wet age related macular degeneration,Chronic glaucoma,Cataracts,"Correct. This patient has early signs of age-related macular degeneration with moderate loss of reading fine print. Additionally, the presence of drusen without other features of late onset disease such as geographic atrophy or neovascularization suggest this is not advanced disease.","Incorrect. Patients with late-stage disease can be identified in two ways - firstly their symptoms may include advanced visual changes such as metamorphopsia, micropsia and macropsia. Secondly, they may have fundoscopic changes such as geographic atrophy which is the most severe form of dry AMD. Geographic atrophy refers to the sharply demarcated area of atrophy affecting the macula. 
","Incorrect. Wet AMD is more severe than any type of dry AMD and is characterised by neovascularization. Symptoms are often sudden and deteriorate rapidly, and the presence of new vessels may be seen on fundoscopy. This was not the case in this patient’s scenario.","Incorrect. Although chronic glaucoma presents with gradual vision loss, vision loss is usually peripheral rather than central, and you would expect to see changes to the optic disc such as cupping and potentially a raised intraocular pressure on tonometry.","Incorrect. Cataracts present with gradually worsening blurry vision, glare, complaints of halos around lights and loss of colour vision. Fundoscopy would identify a leukocoria, and a slit-lamp examination would reveal a clouded lens.",1

Extracellular material is deposited, but not into the photoreceptors.","Incorrect. Though ischemia causing VEGF production does lead to wet AMD, vessel regression is not a feature of macular degeneration.","Correct. AMD is associated with inflammation and lipofuscin deposition in Bruch’s membrane, which is seen as drusen. This leads to reduced nutrients delivered to the RPE, causing excess of VEGF and abnormal vessel growth.","Incorrect. This may be a pathophysiological feature in chronic glaucoma, where increased pressures lead to reduced transport of trophic factors which are important for cell development. This may lead to optic nerve injury.","Incorrect. Viral causes are not known to lead to AMD or act as a risk factor.

These features are typically seen in more advanced courses of disease in dry AMD, so for it to present so rapidly suggests wet AMD. Furthermore, the presence of neovascularization on fundoscopy confirms this diagnosis.","Diabetic retinopathy is an unlikely diagnosis here. Although the proliferative form of diabetic retinopathy may show neovascularization on fundoscopy, you would also expect to see cotton wool spots, hard exudates and microaneurysms. Furthermore, vision loss is typically much more gradual and this patient does not have diabetes either.","Acute angle closure glaucoma is an ocular emergency which presents with an acutely painful and red eye, with rapid changes in vision. The disease is typically unilateral, although both eyes can be affected. Patients are often systemically unwell with headaches, nausea and vomiting. Moreover, you would expect the affected eye to show a dilated pupil which is unresponsive to light.

Wet AMD arises from neovascularization secondary to ischaemia and increased VEGF production. These new vessels are frail and abnormal, therefore bleed easily.","Correct. Geographic atrophy is the most severe form of dry AMD, but it is not seen in wet AMD (unless there is progression from dry AMD to wet AMD). Geographic AMD is characterised by a sharply demarcated area of atrophy affecting the macula (referred to as “geographic atrophy”).
","Incorrect. Metamorphopsia is described as visual distortion, with examples including curving of otherwise straight lines (such as a windowpane).","Incorrect. Macropsia is seeing images that are larger than expected, which this patient is complaining of.",Incorrect.

This patient is not currently taking any medications which could cause hallucinations such as corticosteroids, opioids or anticholinergic medications. Drug induced psychosis often presents similarly to schizophrenia but they may also have confusion and agitation.","Correct. Charles Bonnet syndrome (also known as visual release hallucinations) is a disorder that is typically seen in elderly patients who have an underlying visual problem, typically macular degeneration. Patients often have no other psychiatric history and understand that their hallucination is not real. It may also be seen in glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy.","Incorrect. Though hallucinations may be seen as a feature of dementia, they are typically later onset, with other symptoms such as cognitive decline and memory loss being more dominant. Additionally, dementia cannot be diagnosed until organic causes (such as hypothyroidism) have been ruled out and the patient is formally assessed to check their cognitive function.",4

Anti VEGF therapies are a useful tool in the management of wet AMD and are recommended first line in all patients with neovascular disease.,"Incorrect. Laser photocoagulation is recommended only for specific patients with vessels that are not located very closely to the fovea. Without further information, it is difficult to say if this would be useful in the management of this patient.","Incorrect. Retinopexy is a process that uses lasers to adhere a detached retina back in place. There is no indication for this at present, since the patient did not present with any features of retinal detachment such as photopsia (flashes), floaters or a sudden loss of vision starting from the peripheries (nasal/temporal and superior/inferior).",Incorrect. This procedure may be done as a second line option in wet AMD and uses verteporfin (which is taken up selectively) and a laser to specifically damage abnormal vessels or occlude them to prevent leakage.

The pattern of weakness is often descending paralysis and as such the arms here are affected before the legs. In GBS, you would typically expect an ascending paralysis. Furthermore, patients commonly complain of back pain or paraesthesias in the distal extremities before the onset of their weakness.","The bilateral weakness here makes a stroke less likely, as we would expect more unilateral features. Classical features include ipsilateral limb ataxia, nystagmus ipsilateral to the side of the lesion and dysarthria. The history of a preceding infection, as well as dampened reflexes on examination, makes MFS a more likely diagnosis.","Syringomyelia refers to the formation of a syrinx (cyst in the spinal canal). It may form in the C-Spine and stretch the anterior white commissure (crossing point of the spinothalamic tracts) leading to bilateral loss of pain and temperature sensation. As the swelling gets bigger, it may lead to bilateral limb weakness. However the lack of the sensory features makes this diagnosis unlikely.","Myasthenia gravis is a reasonable differential here. It explains the diplopia, dysphagia and muscle weakness. However it does not account for the ataxia and reduced reflexes.

A lesion here leads to difficulty in the generation of speech, stuttering or finding the correct words, rather than an inability to understand. Patients with an isolated lesion here will be able to comprehend instructions but may have difficulty speaking.","Wenicke’s encephalopathy has a very specific triad of ophthalmoplegia, confusion and ataxia, which arises as a result of thiamine (vitamin B1). This is very important to rule out in patients who are alcohol dependent or pregnant. It is distinctly different from Wernicke’s aphasia which leads to an inability to comprehend verbal or written commands but the patient retains their ability to generate speech. Often the patient does not answer the question and may not make sense.",Correct. Wernicke’s area of the brain is part of the temporal lobe. The role of this area is to understand and comprehend verbal or written commands. A lesion here leads to an inability to comprehend verbal or written commands but the patient retains their ability to generate speech. Often the patient does not answer the question and may not make sense.,"Staccato speech is seen in cerebellar disorders or lesions. It leads to a staggered and interrupted speech with distinct pauses between the syllables. The patient here is speaking fluently, however cannot comprehend instructions and as such this is Wernicke’s aphasia.","Dysarthria is slurred speech. In the context of a stroke this suggests more of a brainstem lesion as the muscles of the larynx and pharynx are controlled by the medulla. Here the patient is not slurring their speech.

Large central scotomas are associated with macular degeneration, not stroke.",<p> Correct. Stroke most commonly leads to a homonymous hemianopia. This is because the optic radiations of each hemisphere supply the ipsilateral temporal and contralateral nasal retina. Remember light enters from the opposite sides (i.e. the nasal retina visualises the temporal side). As such a stroke leads to ipsilateral loss of nasal and contralateral loss of temporal vision. </p> Furthermore this is an MCA stroke. The MCA supplies the part of the occipital lobe which processes information from the macula. As such an MCA infarct leads to loss of macular vision.,"The side of the homonymous hemianopia is correct. However, this is an MCA stroke. The MCA supplies the part of the occipital lobe which processes information from the macula. As such an MCA infarct leads to loss of macular vision.

The patient is also not complaining of any features which would raise the suspicion of a lower urinary tract infection.,"Spirometry is unlikely to add any extra information nor change management of the stroke. The patient is not demonstrating any features of respiratory disease. Spirometry can be useful if the weakness was caused by Guillain-Barre syndrome or myasthenia gravis, however these cause bilateral rather than unilateral symptoms.",An echocardiogram can be useful to visualise infective vegetations in suspected infective endocarditis (infection of the heart valves).

Aspirin is an antiplatelet medication which works by inhibiting platelet aggregation. As such this may perpetuate and worsen a hemorrhagic stroke.,"Correct. The ECG demonstrates irregularly irregular QRS complexes without clearly discernible p waves, confirming atrial fibrillation. Acute focal neurological features, especially in the presence of AF, strongly raises the suspicion of a stroke and thus needs to be investigated with an urgent non-contrast CT head.","Alteplase is a fibrinolytic agent which causes the breakdown of clots. It is used in the management of stroke, however should only be administered once a hemorrhagic stroke has been ruled out.","A non-contrast CT head is the first line investigation to investigate a suspected stroke. MRI heads take around half an hour to perform. In a stroke, the longer the tissue remains hypoxic, the worse the neurological complications. As such a CT scan should be performed as it can be done faster.","A non-contrast CT is used in the investigation of stroke rather than a contrast CT head.

In the presence of an ischaemic stroke a high blood pressure is often a physiological mechanism to maintain adequate perfusion pressure. It should not be aggressively reduced as it can lead to further hypoperfusion of the brain. Blood pressure should only be reduced if in the presence of a hypertensive emergency (such as hypertensive encephalopathy or nephropathy).,"Following a stroke, patients are often left with swallowing difficulties which significantly increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia. As such patients with a stroke should have an assessment of swallowing (ideally in the first 24 hours) but no later than 72 hours.",Patients with diabetes should have agressive control of glucose to maintain levels between 4.0-11.0,Early mobilisation via physiotherapy should be the goal with all stroke patients where they are fit to do so.

It often presents much more acutely with features of pancytopenia. In this case, the patient is generally well other than persistent tiredness. Other features of ALL may include recurrent and easy bruising, epistaxis, bone pain, recurrent infections.","Correct. The blood test shows isolated leukocytosis with predominant lymphocytosis. Clinically, the patient has lymph node infiltration as evidenced by palpable, rubbery, non-tender lymphadenopathy. She is otherwise symptomatically well, with normal haemoglobin and platelet levels. As such, CLL is the most likely diagnosis - often asymptomatic, slow-progressing and picked up incidentally.","Acute myeloid leukaemia presents much more acutely with a systemically unwell patient with features of pancytopenia, including easy and recurrent bruising, pallor, and organomegaly. This patient is otherwise clinically well. As well as this, AML often shows pancytopenia on FBC. Here, the haemoglobin and platelet counts are normal.","Chronic myeloid leukaemia often has other findings on examination including hepatosplenomegaly. This is not seen here. CML may be asymptomatic or present with B symptoms. Conversely, lymphadenopathy is not typical of CML. FBC may also show increased band cells (granulocyte precursors at different stages of development) , which is again not seen.","Multiple myeloma is a clonal proliferation of B plasma cells which infiltrate the bone marrow, leading to pancytopenia.

These are absent here.","Depending on immunophenotyping results, immunotherapy can be part of the treatment of CLL. An example would be the use of rituximab in CD20 positive patients, or targeted therapy with ibrutinib. However, imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and is used in the management of CML.
